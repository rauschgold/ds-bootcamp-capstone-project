 - The Programme has reached a pivotal point in its delivery as it moves towards the end of Phase 1. There are important tools in production including the register and migration readiness tools and a commercial agreement with a digitisation supplier. All augers well for delivery of the overall programme. 
 - However, the Programme is still in the learning phase and it needs to guard against the desire to prioritise delivery of Local Authority (LA) migrations over future design and learning.
 - A change of focus on the outcomes from Phase 1, a concentration on the development of useful metrics and the time and space to examine alternate options will give greater confidence that the Programme will deliver its overall objectives and maximise the benefits to UK PLC.

This was mainly due to the stakeholder engagement challenges presented by Brexit - both within central government departments and Wider Government Bodies.  Departments had limited ability to engage in capability building intervention due to having other Brexit pressing priorities

30,A12 Chelmsford to A120 Widening,DfT,A12 Chelmsford to A120 Widening - widening the A12 to three lanes between junction 19 (north of Chelmsford) and junction 25 (A120 interchange). ,Amber,"The IPA Delivery Confidence Assessment (DCA) rating at Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) was Amber, due primarily to the following factors;

 - In September 2019, the project was preparing to announce a preferred route announcement for Junctions 19 to 23, as well as a non-statutory consultation for Junctions 23 to 25. The delivery confidence assessment was based on three key outstanding issues which were causing increased project uncertainty on how the scheme would progress.  

Firstly, there was uncertainty on the timing and outcome of the North Essex Authorities Local Plan, which included the Colchester Braintree Borders Garden Community. Whether the Garden Community was found viable or not in the Local Plan would inform the decision on a proposed route between Junction 23 and 25, as the route may have needed to divert southwards around the proposed Garden Community footprint.
 - Secondly,  in order to divert the road southwards to accommodate the Garden Community, the project required additional funding. The additional funding was to come forward via a Housing Infrastructure Bid submitted by Essex County Council to MHCLG. At the time of the DCA, it was not known whether this would be approved. 
 - Finally, there was a risk of delay to making the PRA for Junction 19-23, a critical milestone to maintain the delivery programme. Approval was subject to discussions with DfT around the interaction with potential RIS3 pipeline projects such as the A120 Braintree to A12. Failure to make the PRA for Junction 19 to 23 in October 2019 would have introduced a significant delay and additional costs.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Amber IPA DCA, the following non-project operating environment activities have impacted the original Q2 IPA DCA;

 - The sources of uncertainty highlighted in the September 19/20 DCA assessment have been resolved.
In May 2020, the Planning Inspector's report on the Local Plan determined that the Colchester Braintree Borders Garden Community was unviable.  This is not expected to be challenged by the Local Authorities.  While Housing and Infrastructure Funding was announced in March 2020, this was conditional on delivering the Garden Community housing.  This funding is now expected to be withdrawn.  
 - With no viable Garden Community, and without funding for the additional costs of realignment of the A12 further south, the project now has clarity on the recommended route alignment.  This recommendation will be taken through governance with the intention of announcing a preferred route for the section between junction 23 to 25 in the autumn.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Amber IPA DCA, the following primary project actions have impacted the original Q2 IPA DCA;

 - The project team announced the Preferred Route for Junctions 19-23  in October 2019. In the same month,  the project launched a non-statutory consultation on four route options between Junctions 23-25 of the A12 to accommodate the Garden Community. In November 2019, the project mobilised a programme of investigative surveys, which were designed to de-risk the preliminary design stage by providing geotechnical and condition data.
 - HE has now completed its internal procedures and the recommendation is going to IPDC on 15 June. Alongside this request, DfT and HMT will consider the use of Highways England Regional Delivery Partnerships as the project's procurement route and development phase funding, which will allow the project to proceed into the development phase of the scheme and prepare its' development consent order.

 - The schedule allows for design development and preparation of the submission to the Planning Inspector. This includes additional surveys, statutory consultation, and further design and assessment works.
 - After the design, under the planning act (2008), an application will be submitted to the Planning Inspector. The statutory timescales for a Development Consent Order are approximately 18 months 
 - Once orders are received there will be a construction period starting in Summer 2023, scheduled for 4 years until Open for Traffic in Summer 2027. One year post opening assessment period is allowed for until Summer 2028.

 - The planning inspector letter on the Local plan was expected by March 31st 2020, however was published on May 19th 2020. This meant there was greater uncertainty for the project for this period while scoping surveys and making preparations for the start of preliminary design.
 - In addition, Covid-19 has impacted on the project schedule. Traffic counts were cancelled in March 2020 due to the reduced traffic as a result of Covid-19 mitigations. The project has put in place revised traffic modelling strategies to minimise the impact of this.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) baseline project end date of 01/05/28, the following primary project actions have impacted the original Q2 baseline project end date;

 - The project has implemented mitigations to respond to the impact of Covid-19, such as revised traffic modelling and a complete review of method statements to ensure activities being undertaken to progress the project are safe.
 - To ensure the project could progress as quickly as possible, two route proposals for Junctions 23 to 25 were progressed through Highways England governance processes (Normally this would be one route). This allowed the project additional time to wait for the Planning Inspector's letter whilst minimising the impact on schedule.

There was concern that the removal of Private Finance as an option would increase costs to a point where the VfM would be too low to sustain the project. This issue has since been resolved with Treasury approval of the OBC in Oct 2019.
 - One of the key risks to the project was Highways England's confidence in successfully passing Development Consent Order (DCO) given the high profile challenges to the scheme from 3rd parties, such as heritage and environmental lobbying groups. This risk was largely mitigated through a successful Examination Phase ending in Oct 19. A DCO decision was due from Secretary of State on 2nd April 2020.  This has been delayed to 17 July 2020.

Enabling Works and initial mobilising of the Main Works Civils are ongoing with sites generally open but there are likely to be some site or contractor-specific challenges to work through. 
 - There has been an increase in protestor action across the line of the route. This is a combination of long-standing action against the programme and a more recent uptick as a result of the emergence of environmental groups . This has created challenges to maintaining schedule.

 - Ł55.7bn (in 2015 prices) represented the then capital estimate for the HS2 project. Whereas ongoing pressures to the estimate and schedule were still being assessed by the Department at Q2 2019/20, there was further scrutiny placed on the project with the publication of the HS2 Chairmans Stocktake report in September. In addition, the independent Oakervee Review was commissioned at the time of producing the Q2 report. It was therefore considered inappropriate for the baseline capital estimate for the project to be amended at that time and the budget remained at Ł55.7bn.

There were also some further delays to the clearance of ancient woodlands, with some sites paused during the Oakervee Review. However, the project continues to pick up pace and drive forward with delivery. The ongoing COVID-19 situation has resulted in revised working methodologies for the project and HS2 Ltd has risen to these challenges. The rapid development and the uncertain outcome of the outbreak means it has not yet been possible to precisely determine its impact on the project. HS2 Ltd is currently working with its suppliers to assess the implications on schedule and cost. The current schedule and cost estimates contain contingency to address the issues which have arisen due to the pandemic.

This review reassessed the deliverability of the project and undertook a further assessment on project cost and schedule. The recommendations were welcomed and adopted by government, with increased focus on savings and ministerial oversight on delivery. In accordance with IPA guidance, the project has re-established a capital estimated cost range for the project: Ł65-88bn (2015 prices) and Ł72-Ł98bn (2019 prices). The Whole Life cost for the HS2 project was included in the Full Business Case for Phase One, which was estimated at Ł108.9bn (2015 prices).

 - The significant progress made in migrating organisations onto new HSCN services, and decommissioning legacy connectivity. Migration pace had increased considerably leading to the programme setting a stretch target of 50% completion by 31st December 2020, which demonstrated the increased level of confidence in programme team capability, leadership, and ability to work productively with suppliers.
 - Increased engagement with NHS England at regional level, and this has helped influence customer behaviours in order to increase pace of migrations
 - Continued validation that HSCN is delivering best value connectivity in comparison to the wider market, and is on average 74% cheaper than legacy N3 connectivity (on a like for like basis)

 - As a result of increased engagement, NHS England now play a more active role at regional level, taking ownership to influence customer behaviours across STPs to help drive migration pace more effectively, and HSCN Programme Board membership now includes regional NHS England digital transformation leads.
 - A tail management strategy including tactical solutions, migration acceleration support and BT interim solutions are in place to drive an August 2020 completion, supporting customers at risk of not migrating by August.

",Amber,"The IPA Delivery Confidence Assessment (DCA) rating at Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) was Amber, which has improved since last years Q2 1819 Amber/Red, due primarily to the following factors;

 - The Programme made significant progress to de-risk Initial Operating Capability position. Primarily, this was related to infrastructure and providing facilities for operating the aircraft in the first six months, both at Naval Air Station Jacksonville (Florida) and Kinloss Barracks, until RAF Lossiemouth infrastructure is ready (expected September 2020).
 - After three years of engineering and safety data gathering, analysis and assessment, the Programme achieved the required airworthiness certification which allowed the aircraft to receive its initial Release-to-Service and Military Type Certificate.
 - Work by the project achieved the necessary mission support facilities to enable initial Marine Patrol Aircraft training and operations, from both NAS Jacksonville and Kinloss. Early concerns around connectivity and ability to provide mission data had been successfully alleviated through forward-leaning intervention.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Amber IPA DCA, the following non-project operating environment activities have impacted the original Q2 IPA DCA;

 - The biggest long-term Programme risk remains the provision of personnel to enable the required growth path to Full Operating Capability. During this period, it became apparent that there were more concerns around the supporting elements necessary to meet workforce assumptions, particularly in engineering/maintenance.
 - Development of wider infrastructure at RAF Lossiemouth, including resurfacing of runways and other sustainment projects, has begun. Whilst outside the MPA Programme, this is a key dependency and good progress has been made which is reducing risk against remaining at Kinloss, the temporary operating base.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Amber IPA DCA, the following primary project actions have impacted the original Q2 IPA DCA;

 - The Programme has taken the decision to draw down supporting facilities and equipment at NAS Jacksonville earlier than planned to focus effort at the UK Main Operating Base at RAF Lossiemouth. This will improve spares and logistic provision and increase the Programme's resilience in the first year of operating.
 -  Further to the mission system preparatory work, the Programme allocated specific 'subject matter expert' personnel to help resolve some challenging integration issues. Although not entirely solved yet, good progress was made.

 - Technical issues were encountered with the new weapon design during the submarine launched trial resulting in the trial being abandoned. The data from this trial was urgently required to support the ongoing technical investigation into weapon reliability and performance of the upgraded fibre-optic guidewire dispensing system.
 - The Weapon Thread project will deliver the submarine combat system upgrades that are necessary to deploy the new weapon.  The schedule for delivery of these changes does not currently support a full transition to the upgraded weapon design before the old weapon design needs to be withdrawn from service.
 - Under the forecasted schedule for the Weapon Thread project the in-service conversion plan that will allow transition from the old weapon design to the new weapon design will place an extreme stress on the operational availability and reserve stockpile levels of the Spearfish Heavy Weight Torpedo.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Red IPA DCA, the following non-project operating environment activities have impacted the original Q2 IPA DCA;

 - At this point the trials programme for the new weapon was dependent on submarine and surface asset availability and, given the operational demand for these assets, it was increasingly difficulty to successfully co-ordinate trials with RN platform availability. Since September 2019 a trials strategy has been developed that mitigates this dependency.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Red IPA DCA, the following primary project actions have impacted the original Q2 IPA DCA;

 - Confidence in the weapon design, especially the fibre-optic dispensing system, has increased significantly following improvements in the manufacturing process, further shore-based testing and a successful repeat of Boat Trial 2. The weapon design has now been frozen and future trials are planned to improve the statistical confidence in weapon reliability.
 - An agreed safety case for the Weapon Thread Minimum Operating Capability design and completion of the Critical Design Review is required to progress through testing to manufacture.

 - By Q2 1920 we had delivered most of what we had planned, but reform remains an extremely challenging and complex programme. It proved challenging to hire software developers for the Civil, Family and Tribunals programme which resulted in delay to the delivery of some services and associated benefits.
 -  Establishing a set of common capabilities that would support all the Civil, Family and Tribunal services proved challenging, and let to a change in strategy to ensure that we can use the common capabilities to run end to end services.
 - There were delays in the delivery of the common platform, which were caused by dependencies with other government agencies and challenges to the pace of software development. We have worked hard to implement a number of changes to pull back this delay.

 - COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the programme, with some productivity expected to be lost due to a lack of co-working and an increase in staff absences. A number of programme resources have been re-prioritised to support operational staff and the rollout of video and audio hearing capabilities.

 - Civil, Family and Tribunal programme continues to deliver products more slowly than expected. To address, CFT have agreed to a new approach, resequencing work to focus on completing both the Common Component and service elements of a single service (services already in delivery will continue as now).
 - We have opened a third Courts and Tribunals Service Centre (CTSC) in early 2020.

The timeline to achieve this transition has, on existing plans, negligible contingency. 
 - There are decisions around the Dynamic Framework, Accelerated Transition and potential contract extensions which mean the baseline will have to be reassessed and we cannot therefore be confident in moving the programme status to Amber at this stage.
