1,Geological Disposal Facility Programme (GDF),BEIS,Amber,"The primary objective of the programme is to site and construct a permanent geological disposal facility (GDF) as the safe, secure and environmentally responsible solution to the long-term management of higher-activity radioactive waste in the UK, excluding Scotland.  The programme also supports the delivery of the UK's nuclear new build programme because before development consents for new nuclear power stations are granted, the Government needs to be satisfied that effective arrangements exist or will exist to manage and dispose of the wastes they will produce. The programme complies with all public procurement policy obligations including the guidance in Procurement Policy Note 16/15. The developer will be able to provide data once we are in the implementation phase of the programme ie we have a designated site and a site specific rather than a generic design. ","The Programme has improved its Amber-Red rating in 2017/18 to Amber in 2018/19 reflecting the good progress made over the past year. The launch of the siting process on 19 December 2018 was an important milestone but this is a long term programme and significant risks still remain, not least the securing of a willing local community to host the GDF.",30/06/2008,31/12/2040,"Planning schedules are in line with the ambition to identify a site and construct a GDF by the 2040s and are kept under review by the developer, Radioactive Waste Management Ltd.",Ł40.27,Ł37.40,-7%,"Ł12,343.96",The small in-year forecast underspend reflects a short delay to the timing of the launch of the siting process which took place in December 2018. ,"The Whole Life Cost figure represents the estimated cost of designing, constructing and operating the GDF out to the 2130s.  Note that the figure reported here only relates to a GDF for legacy waste and waste arising from the existing fleet of nuclear reactors. It does not include any provision for waste disposal from a new nuclear build programme, as this will be funded by new nuclear operators. In line with other Government programmes at an early stage of development, the estimate does not include any allowance for risk, uncertainty or optimism bias.  The increase in costs since last year is primarily down to inflation and revised assumptions during the siting and construction phases.  All figures are provided in real rather than nominal values due to the long timescales associated with this programme.",Infrastructure and Construction

The LLC Programme will deliver a single LLC Register Service for England (the inclusion of the LLC Registers in Wales will be subject to a further business case), implementing the powers granted to HM Land Registry under the Infrastructure Act 2015. The scope of the Programme is to take the 326 English Local Authorities registers and replace them with a single digital register, resulting in Land Registry becoming the sole registering authority and official search provider for LLC.","The service is now live and HMLR is working with a range of local authorities to migrate thier data. This has been slower than planned due to a number of factors: readiness and resource availability within local authorities, the complexity of creating consistent geospatial data from the current data sets and the time taken to procure and on-board the digitisation and transformation supplier. The key aim for Phase 1 is to inform our learning about the new service, its impact on customers and market - and the costs and time taken to migrate the service to the national digital Register.  This learning is being applied in real time to the inflight migrations, including investing in AI to inform understanding of the data issues and speed up the transformation process.

24,Apprenticeships Reform Programme,DFE,Amber,"A multifaceted transformation programme, aiming to deliver against 4 key strategic objectives: 
ˇ       To meet the skills needs of employers - and the country by being high quality, relevant programmes that result in apprentices becoming fully competent in their occupation
ˇ       To create progression for apprentices - by creating high quality programmes that result in apprentices becoming fully competent with transferrable skills in an occupation that offers progression.
ˇ       To widen participation and social mobility in apprenticeships  to ensure that more people from a diverse range of backgrounds have access to the benefits of apprenticeships at all levels. 
ˇ       To create more quality apprenticeships - through our campaign work and by creating a sustainable funding system and a high quality apprenticeships offer.

We have successfully developed and implemented a new employer levy and funding system, designed and implemented a new digital online IT system which enables employers to manage their apprenticeship programmes and established a new Institute for Apprenticeships all of which completed in April 2017. We are supporting transition from apprenticeship frameworks to new employer designed standards, establishing ways to raise BAME participation rates by 20%, designing a policy to ensure inclusive apprenticeships to support social mobility and, with the support of the Institute, significantly uplifting the quality and quantity of apprenticeships. We will also implement a comprehensive strategy to support employers and providers to understand the changes to the apprenticeship system and ensure that the wider market is ready.","Apprenticeships will now phase the roll-out of the service to non-levy payers next year, rather than the big-bang approach originally planned. This change is welcomed. There is also now widespread acceptance across Whitehall that the Programme will miss the 3m target and instead must focus on achieving the highest number of quality starts possible by 2020. As a result of both decisions, revised DCA to Amber, although there remain to be significant delivery challenges. The Programme has a new SRO who was previously the Apprenticeships Programme Director. The Programme has also changed its Governance, with the aim of ensuring the Programme Board focuses on strategic direction (especially given the Apprenticeships Post-2020 Vision work ongoing within DfE) as well as benefits realisation.

This budget is very difficult to forecast as there is a lot of uncertainty around employer behaviour following the introduction of the new levy.  Starts delivered since introduction of the Levy in May continue to be very low and show a reduction of 61% compared to the same time last year. The new levy has transformed the way that Apprenticeships operate in addition to the transition from frameworks to standards. This is a lot of change for both employers and the market to get used to. Employer behaviour is hard to predict and it is very difficult to accurately forecast spend during a period of such uncertainty. Our updated forecast for 2017/18 reflects the reduction in the number of starts and also the slippage in our other spending plans as the need for enhancements to the Apprenticeships Funding Service are assessed. This has resulted in an expected underspend compared to baseline in 2017/18. 
As employers have 2 years to spend their levy funds It is likely that spending will increase in the next financial year resulting in higher than expected costs in 2019/20 and onwards. There is still a high level of uncertainty around these forecasts.
Enhancements and changes to the Apprenticeships Funding Service are still being planned and the split between investment in change and Recurring new costs reflects current known plans. This will be updated as further enhancements obtain ministerial approval.

The vast majority of schools in PSBP1 have been handed over by the end of 2017, two years earlier than originally announced.

- Under the second phase known as PSBP2, individual blocks of accommodation at 277 schools are being rebuilt and/or refurbished using capital grant and are scheduled to hand over by the end of 2023.

- To ensure value for money for the public sector, schools in both phases of the programme are grouped together to make projects (or batches) that will be commercially attractive and drive strong competition. This grouping of projects also allows us to take advantage of economies of scale in procurement in terms of both time and cost.
