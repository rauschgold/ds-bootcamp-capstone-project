A new research Institution will be established involving the construction of a new facility located close to St Pancras station, London.  This facility will accommodate 1,268 scientists when fully operational.  The National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) will be closed.  The funds from the sale of the former NIMR site at Mill Hill and the former National Temperance Hospital site will be used as part of this project.","On 1st April 2015 the NIMR  transferred to the Francis Crick Institute.  This highly complex transfer included the transfer of 611 former NIMR  staff by TUPE, all NIMR assets and the leasing of the NIMR site.  Construction of the new Francis Crick Institute near  St. Pancras is scheduled to be complete as planned in November 2015.  However, Practical Completion of the building is delayed due to difficulties in completing the extensive commissioning activities.  This delay will not impact on the planned overall end date of the project as staff and equipment occupation plans will be accelerated.  The project remains within the budget set in 2010. On 30th June 2015 contracts were exchanged with a Developer to sell the NIMR site at Mill Hill.

In preparation for the implementation of new technologies the programme has been working with suppliers to develop and agree rollout plans for the new technologies planned to commence in February 2016.

The major risk to the CPS and the programme is disruption to services.  There are some new technologies to be rolled out and this continues to give rise to some programme risk.

In Q1 2015/16 an overspend was forecast against the 2015/16 budget due to changes to the project timetable. Additional budget was sought in DECC's mid year review.","The Whole Life Costs (WLC) for this project are determined by the difference between the Strike Price for Hinkley Point C and the long-term Wholesale Electricity Price forecasts, which are influenced by market prices for fossil fuels.  Therefore, we would expect the WLC to vary year on year to reflect changes in the market.  From 2014 to 2015, DECCs projections of wholesale electricity prices fell, reflecting underlying low fossil fuel prices and a subsequent reduction in DECCs gas and coal projections.  This resulted in an increase in the whole life costs for Hinkley Point C.
Wholesale prices are volatile and sensitive to a number of uncertain factors including, for example, future global gas price trends, carbon prices, coal prices, the level of intermittent generators in the system and demand trends.  Whereas the strike price agreed for Hinkley Point C is fixed and has been set following extensive negotiations with EDF and with advice from independent expert advisors.  Hinkley Point C alone will generate 7% of reliable low carbon electricity for the UK; enough to power 6 million homes for 65 years.",2016

A re-baselining of the programme schedule in 2010 meant that costs have been incurred in different years than originally anticipated. Despite this the Crossrail project is still forecast to come within the total available budget. ,This constitutes the funding envelope for the project as a whole. There are a series of intervention points set out in the governance documents which are designed to mitigate against the risk of exceeding the total funding available.

40,Rail Franchising Programme,DFT,Amber,To secure the provision of passenger rail services as set out under the Railways Act 1993 (as amended) by letting Rail Franchises.,"The Rail Franchising Programme continues to deliver in line with the published schedule. Since Q2 we have made 3 franchise awards- 1 through Direct Award (West Midlands) and 2 following competition (Northern and TransPennine Express (TPE)). These awards will deliver significant benefits for passengers and higher returns to the exchequer. The Northern and TPE franchises will begin 1 April 2016 and work to mobilise them continues. This includes the formation of the joint Rail North/ DfT commercial management teams in Leeds, which will see a more localised approach to the franchises and is a step toward eventual devolution. 
The most recent issue of the franchise schedule included a retiming of the InterCity West Coast competition to ensure it is well aligned with the HS2 programme. The ICWC operator will play an important role during the construction of HS2 and in facilitating the introduction of High Speed services in 2026. This retiming will allow us to continue to engage with the market on the best options for the franchise to do this. 
We have also made changes in the procurement process to introduce a Passport approach to prequalification of bidders, which will make the franchise bidding process simpler and reduce the barriers to entry for new entrants to the market. This has been designed to streamline the pre-qualification process for rail franchise competitions. In particular, the Passport System is intended to reduce the time and cost involved for Applicants in providing detailed technical information for multiple rail franchise competitions. A Passport is needed for any organisation to express an interest in any future rail franchise competition.
We currently have teams working on 3 live franchise competitions at various stages of completion. West Midlands and South Western are undergoing consultation exercises and developing specifications; East Anglia is currently evaluating bids in preparation for award in the summer. The West Coast team is also in place doing preparatory work to launch the competition later this year. 
A recent PAC report into the programme confirmed the significant progress we have made in improving franchising and the benefits that it has brought to passengers since the launch of the programme in 2013. It highlighted the need to continue to ensure that the franchise market remains competitive. We are taking active steps to do this by working with OGDs and altering our policies to encourage new entrants to the market.

 - The target opening date for Phase 1 remains  2026, with Phase 2a (Birmingham to Crewe) to open in 2027, and the rest of the Y (Crewe to Manchester and Birmingham to Leeds) in 2033.

 - The Spending Review 2015 (SR15) settlement announced on 25 November 2015 provides Ł14.8bn of capital funding for the programme over the next five years and sets out an updated funding envelope of Ł55.7bn for delivering HS2 in 2015 prices. This was an excellent outcome for the programme, and provides the funding for construction of Phase 1 to start in 2017 and keeps plans for Phase 2 on track.

 - An updated programme cost and schedule baseline (BL6) has been developed which contains a further level of granularity to inform the assumptions against which the Invitation To Tender for the Main Works Civils Contracts will be assessed. We expect BL6 to be adopted in April 2016.

 - New programme governance arrangements were implemented in December 2015, including a new Programme Board and three new Sponsor Boards (for Phase 1, Phase 2 and Commercial Operations) reporting to it. 

 - There has been significant progress on building capability in the client and delivery organisations as the programme transitions towards the delivery phase, through DfT and HS2 Ltd developing Delivery, procurement and commercial strategies and demonstrating that the right capabilities and skills are in place to move forwards with procurements.  

 - The Integrated Programme Management Office has been set up to put in place effective processes for joint planning, reporting and risk management across the wider programme.

 - Following further work with the rail industry and Network Rail, a revised scheme for Euston station was developed, with a 3 stage delivery plan to support Phase 1, Phase 2 and 'classic' rail. The revised plan for Euston was outlined in Additional Provision 3 to the hybrid Bill, which was approved by the Chancellor and deposited in Parliament in September 2015.
 - The Secretary of State has granted approval for HS2 Ltd to be appointed as the Agent responsible for the procurement of a Master Development Partner for Over Site Development (OSD) at Euston. 
 - The procurement process was also started for seven million trees to be planted alongside the London to West Midlands line to mitigate its impact on woodland. A contract is expected to be awarded in the autumn of 2016, which will provide time for the trees to grow to a sufficient size to be planted out during construction. 
 - On 30 November 2015, the Secretary of State announced his decision to accelerate part of the Phase 2 route (Phase 2a - Birmingham to Crewe), in order to bring benefits to the North earlier, and we commenced work to prepare a hybrid Bill for Parliament to take this forward. Property compensation arrangements for Phase 2a were announced along with the direction of travel on Phase 2b (Crewe to Manchester and Birmingham to Leeds), and the next steps on Crewe and Leeds stations. Sir David Higgins also published his findings on his review of the redevelopment options for Leeds station to prepare it for HS2.
 - The contract was awarded for the Phase 2a Parliamentary Agents on 25 February, who will be responsible for the drafting of the Phase 2a hybrid Bill.
 - A report was published on 21 March on the Broad options for upgraded and high speed railways to the North of England and Scotland, together with a joint UK/Scottish Government statement on next steps.

 -The  National College for High Speed Rail was incorporated in July 2015 and is on track to open in 2017, with funding through BIS agreed as part of the SR15 announcement in November 2015. Construction contracts were let for the new Doncaster and Birmingham National College sites in February and March 2016 respectively, with construction due to start in April 2016. 
 - In March, the Secretary of State approved the principles, high-level terms and process through which the DfT-owned land at Old Oak Common will be transferred to the Old Oak Common and Park Royal Development Corporation (OPDC). A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the land transfer was then signed between Government and the OPDC on 15 March and an announcement on this made during the 2016 Budget.

 improve local connectivity and local network for all users;
 improve safety for road users and community;
 recognise the wider benefits of road investment and leave a positive legacy. 
","Highways Englands intention is for the A14 to be an exemplar for commercial and procurement best practice in the delivery of major projects. The strategy for delivery has centred on the Collaborative Delivery Framework (CDF) which centres upon the core belief of Highways England that significantly better value can be achieved through its supply chain with greater collaboration and engagement. The Integrated Delivery Team has been formed to enable collaboration between the various partners in the design and construction process along with Highways England. The partners are incentivised to drive down costs and to deliver early. Incentives have been set at a project wide level so that the performance of the A14 scheme, and its completion as a whole, will determine the level of incentive payments.

Successful delivery is forecast with the constant monitoring of programme, budget, spend and management of key risks to delivery. All critical delivery areas have dedicated leaders and are appropriately resourced. A key risk to achieving the start of works commitment is legal challenge to the Development Consent Order outcome.

 An Addendum to the Business Case is continuing through the approvals process.
 Resource capacity within Health & Social Care Information Centre continues to be under planned against requirements, specifically business analysts, account manager and commercial roles.
 Principal Clinical System supplier delivery progresses at pace. However, some suppliers are rebaselining delivery plans, as a result of their move to a new technology platform.
 With regard to the Interface Mechanism, engagement with existing suppliers and potential new suppliers is underway in order to bring more suppliers through the delivery pipeline.  To date there are 56 suppliers at various stages of engagement within the pairing process.

The Programme was assessed as a Red delivery confidence status during the Programme Assurance Review and subsequently improved to an Amber/Red status at the Gate 2. Following each review the Programme has addressed the recommendations provided via action plans with regular reviews by the Programme Board, which incorporates permanent Major Projects Authority membership. Both reviews noted the considerable progress that had been made by the Programme but also noted further work that was required to increase the delivery confidence of the Programme. The reviews also noted the resource pressures that the Programme had operated under and that the short timeline available for delivery represented a severe challenge.

Several recurring themes of review recommendations have been identified and these have provided a particular focus for the Programme Team. They include Communications and Stakeholder Engagement, Governance and Programme Controls, Procurement Strategy and Solution Design works. All have since received comprehensive review and assurance to ensure that they are fit for purpose.

Following quarter two 2015/16 and the Gate 2b review the Programme has made considerable progress to address the recommendations whilst continuing its progress towards delivery of the Health and Social Care Network. The Programme successfully navigated a tightly planned assurance and approval cycle for the Outline Business Case which resulted in its formal approval in December 2015.

The financial impact had been caused by delays to the migration from NHSmail 1 to NHSmail 2. The review also helpfully identified areas of improvement, for example in informing customers of the transformation. The Programme has addressed the concerns raised by the review including agreeing a financial baseline. A Major Projects Authority Assurance of Action Plan review took place in February 2016 to demonstrate this. The first stage of the Programme (active directory  co-existence) has gone live and future go-lives are planned for 2016, with the first email account planned for migration from the service by April 2016. As per the  agreed change request, the NHSmail 2 project end date has been amended from March 2020 to February 2021 in order to preserve the generation of 60 months of benefits and align the contract with the agreed 5 year term.",29/03/2012,01/06/2020,The Programme encountered delays in the first go-live due to additional work required to ensure that the NHSmail service would migrate from the incumbent supplier to new without impacting the user community.

At the time of writing, these elements were being considered as part of the Spending Review in November 2015.  Non-approval of the other elements would cause a significant delay due to re-design etc., hence the Amber delivery confidence.
As at Q2 2015/16, any delay in an overall OBC decision also raises risks around potential loss of the GSK site and supply chain interest.

This is from both EEA and non-EEA members states.,"The programme delivery status is rated as amber. This is because, while all projects are progressing well with some having being completed and now being transitioned to business as usual, overall programme risk is rated as amber/red because the programme is reliant on a shift in the culture across NHS organisations towards one which is focussed on identifying and charging chargeable patients, if it is to reach its trajectory goals. 
 
As at Q2 2015/15, the programme has one high and two medium impact issues, which could have impacts on the ability of the programme to deliver.  These are: that the impact assessment sent to the Senior Review Committee reflected a lower than expected net benefit of extending charging (high); getting cross-Government clearance  of the extending charging consultation (medium); and concerns around future leadership from ALBs (medium).  It is not anticipated that these issues would lead to a cost or schedule overrun.
 
A number of recommendations were made at the last review to which the Programme has responded positively and to IPAs satisfaction.
",01/09/2013,31/03/2017,"Initially the programme was due to close in March 2016.  The Programme Board, following advice from the IPA, extended the programme in August, so that it would close in March 2017, with the current SRO agreeing to extend his term.

For those who are not able to do this, the Department has introduced the 2012 Child Maintenance Scheme, which significantly simplifies the calculation rules and provides a modern IT platform. ","The Infrastructure Projects Authority completed a review in August 2015 and strongly endorsed extending the programme to December 2016.  The IPA will revisit the programme in Summer 2016 to assess the programme, including the management of the key delivery risks and whether the programme remains on track for its formal programme closure in December 2016. 

",01/08/2009,31/12/2016,"Phase 1 of the programme is complete. This introduced the new IT system, a mandatory gateway to encourage family based arrangements, and where these arrangements cannot be made, then application to the statutory 2012 scheme.  

Phase 2 introduced client charging and triggered the start of proactive closure of old Child Support Agency cases and successfully went live between 30 June 2014 and 11 August 2014. 
The programme is closing existing cases in a phased and careful way, giving parents the option to make their own arrangements or to transfer where appropriate to the new system without disrupting existing maintenance payments.

Case Closure of Segments 1-5 (around 900,000 cases) remains on track to complete by late 2017.  Case Closure for Arrears Only cases (around 600,000 cases) is planned to start from mid 2017 and complete in early 2019.   This will enable the retirement of the previous scheme IT systems.

Greater numbers of clients are reaching agreements between themselves through Family Based Arrangements than originally assumed, and more clients who have applied to the 2012 scheme are making payments between themselves using the Direct Pay service instead of using the Collect and Pay Service. This has led to a reduced staff requirement and lower running costs. In addition, the programme has accelerated Case Closure since the previous business case.

66,Automatic Enrolment Programme ,DWP,Amber,"The Automatic Enrolment Programme was established to implement the Governments workplace pension reforms. The overarching aim of the reforms is to get more people saving more for their retirement. The Programme went live in October 2012, delivering:   
1) Automatic enrolment - a new duty on employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme; and to increase the incentive to remain saving in a pension scheme, there is a mandatory employer contribution.
2) The National Employment Savings Trust  which has a public service obligation to accept any employer who wishes to use it to meet their employer duty. It provides a good quality pension to individuals on low to moderate earnings. 
3) An employer compliance regime - run by the Pension Regulator to support these measures. 

The implementation approach is gradual, with employers being 'staged' by size, over the period October 2012 to February 2018; and contributions to pension schemes are being gradually increased over time to provide a period of adjustment for employers and individuals, with full contributions being paid from April 2019.
 
Once fully implemented the Department expects to see around 9 million people newly saving or saving more into a workplace pension, and an increase in pension saving of around Ł15 billion a year. ","Programme implementation has been successful, with over 5.8 million people automatically enrolled by over 79,000 employers, high levels of compliance amongst employers and opt-out rates amongst individuals remaining low at around 10%. 

The Programme was positively assessed by The National Audit Office in November 2015, while noting the challenge of supporting the very large volumes of small and micro employers to meet their duties from January 2016 onwards.       

In preparation for this, the Programme delivered a significant piece of work over Autumn 2015 to tailor its communications for smaller employers. This included a refreshed TPR website, revised employer guidance, an on-line tool to assess the eligibility of workers, and a national communications campaign to help raise awareness. 
",01/05/2007,30/11/2018,"The Programme went live on time. The implementation approach has been designed to accommodate the significant increase in volumes over the 2015-2018 period.  The Programme is on track to deliver to timetable.

When fully rolled out it is expected that up to 7 million households will receive Universal Credit.,"The delivery confidence assessment awarded at the Infrastructure Projects Authority (and associated Major Projects Review Group) Review in October 2015 reflected the significant progress the Programme has made since the previous rating given in March 2014. 
In awarding an Amber delivery confidence assessment, the IPA acknowledged that the Universal Credit Programme:
 has made considerable progress;
 has strong leadership in place;
 is integrated with partners with stakeholders actively engaged (with plans in place to strengthen further);
 has a single agreed end-to-end delivery plan; 
 is rolling out at pace Universal Credit nationally to single unemployed claimants across GB, and 
 is demonstrating evidence of positive Labour Market effects.        
The Programme has implemented all recommendations from earlier IPA reviews. The latest IPA recommendations have been accepted by the Programme, and action owners have been assigned and implementation action plans drawn up. All recommendations and action plans will be subject to regular monitoring and independent scrutiny to ensure all necessary action is being taken to address and close the recommendations at the earliest opportunity.     
",17/11/2011,30/04/2020,"Delivery remains on track. HMT have approved the Universal Credit Outline Business Case. 

National Rollout of Universal Credit to single unemployed claimants, in 712 Jobcentres and 380 Local Authorities, completed as planned in April 2016.  UC is now available across the whole of Great Britain.

A cohort analysis of the first 8,000 people to claim Universal Credit against a comparator for Jobseekers Allowance (JSA) shows that Universal Credit claimants spend 10 hours more per week looking for work, are 8% more likely to be in work and, on average, work 12 days longer than people on JSA.

Testing of the digitally enabled service for all Universal Credit claimants continues to expand and is now in eight jobcentres  The full service began rolling out nationally from May 2016.

From May 2016, the full service will be delivered in phases initially at 5 jobcentres per month, then scaled up to 50 jobcentres a month in 2017. As each jobcentre rolls out, all new claims will be to Universal Credit, and it will no longer be possible, in that location, to make a new claim to JSA, Employment Support Allowance, Income Support, Housing Benefit or Tax Credits. By the middle of 2018 this transition will be complete and it will no longer be possible to make a claim for legacy benefits or Tax Credits anywhere in Great Britain.

Finally, the migration of claimants in receipt of legacy benefits on a national scale will begin in 2018 with Universal Credit completing by May 2021.

The key objectives are: 

 to optimise the use of HMRCs earnings, employment and pensions data  for Universal Credit and other income-related benefits, including working with local authorities on Housing Benefit;  

 to have a debt and deduction recovery solution in place enabling existing cases of DWP, HMRC, local authority debt and other additional third party deductions to be recovered on migration to Universal Credit (UC); 

 to deliver the Single Fraud Investigation Service (SFIS) project to provide cross-government anti-fraud services; 

 to provide members of the public with a userfriendly and confidential service to report benefit fraud online; 

 to increase emphasis on prevention and improved support for detection and investigative action by delivering a business rules-based routing and management system; and

The current service delivery system is the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight service (CHIEF).  Each year this business critical service handles c.50 million declarations and accounts for Ł34bn revenue, set in a context of an international trade supply chain that is worth Ł700bn p.a. to the UK economy. This is a business critical declaration processing system handling movements of 3rd country (non-EU) goods. CHIEF operates real time, 24 hours per day, 365 days of the year.The current CHIEF system is more than 23 years old and based on aging Virtual Machine Environment (VME) technology. The service has reached a point where any changes (including EU legislative) will be both expensive and technically very difficult to implement.  HMRC are seeking to replace CHIEF with a robust, scaleable and extensible set of import /export services, capable of delivering this critical function into the future.  ","Customs Declaration Services programme (CDS) is on course for successful delivery subject to continued management of key risks around: keeping to agreed CDS timelines - including successfully procuring and integrating two commercial-off-the-shelf software packages in 2016; and continuing to secure the full range of resources and expertise required from within HMRC, wider government and UK Trade.  Progress has been made on developing the programme level End-to-End Delivery Plan, including the integration of components through 2016 and in driving the development of a comprehensive CDS Resource Plan to support delivery.

Although CDS scored an MPA RAG Rating (and delivery confidence assessment) of 'Amber/Red' at 30 June 2015, this has subsequently improved and was recognised by an MPA Gateway 0 assurance review  in July 2015 which provided CDS with a delivery confidence assessment of 'Amber'.

The Programme objectives for the scope reflected in the Business Case are to:
 Ensure there is continuity of IT supply to the Department and its customers once the current contractual arrangements through the ASPIRE contracts expire in June 2017;
 Ensure that new sourcing arrangements provide better value for money, drive out savings compared to current baseline and are market aligned and consistent with Government standards for ICT contracts and IT delivery; Ensure the operating model for IT in HMRC is transformed to enable HMRCs digital and data transformation and to ensure that changes can be made more flexibly and at greater speed through a new target operating model, sourcing model and re-engineered processes;
 Ensure HMRC has the capacity and capability to operate its new IT operating model on a sustainable basis;

Unions noted the TUPE transfer as an example of best practice.
Prior to proceeding with SCD, a Readiness Checkpoint Review (RCR) was undertaken to confirm that both parties were ready to proceed and that there was no increased risk to operational output. The RCR was conducted in early July, with the IPA providing independent assurance, and reported to a specially convened principals meeting prior to 1 August 2015. On the basis of the review's findings the recommendation was to proceed to SCD as planned. The programme was reviewed in February 2016 and a further review is planned for July 2016.

Recruitment to the Commissioning and Management Organisation(CMO) is progressing well with all posts now being covered (either on a permanent or temporary basis) and the permanent Head of the CMO has been appointed.
