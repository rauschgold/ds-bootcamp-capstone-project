"Description / Aims 
","To renew and modernise the FE College estate with modern, versatile buildings, facilities and industry standard equipment; through a well managed, benefit/value-focused programme; offering learners high quality learning environments in line with the FE College Capital Investment Strategy (December 2012) and Ministerial priorities","The Francis Crick Institute (formerly UKCMRI) is a joint venture between the UK's largest biomedical research and academic institutions: The Medical Research Council (MRC), Cancer Research UK (CRUK), the Wellcome Trust, University College London,  Kings College, London and Imperial College, London.  A new research Institution will be established involving the construction of a new facility located close to St Pancras station, London.  This facility will accommodate 1,268 scientists when fully operational.  The National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) will be closed.  This NIMR site at Mill Hill and the National Temperance Hospital site will be disposed of as part of this project.  The project aims are: Sustain UK's position as a leader in biomedical research; Engagement with the most challenging research questions; A scale to compete with major new overseas developments; Promote the health of the public and wider UK economy; Address key concerns of 2006 Cooksey review on publicly-funded healthcare research; Excellent training environment for biomedical research.","To build a green investment bank, to accelerate a transition to a green economy, by engaging in activities which the company’s board considers will, or are likely to, facilitate the development or expansion of  businesses; enterprises; industries; infrastructure; projects or technologies which, in the opinion of the board of the company, have an environmentally beneficial objective, such as  facilitating the reduction in greenhouse gases; improving resource efficiency or protecting and enhancing the natural environment. ","To put higher education funding on a sustainable footing from September 2012 by shifting public spending away from teaching grants towards repayable tuition fee loans and contribute to eliminating the economic deficit while maintaining high quality in higher education. This overarching objective is supported by a number of subsidiary objectives with the following key deliverables:

• Generation of £3 billion savings annually by 2014-15 
• A single regulatory framework by Academic Year (AY)15/16 
• Quality of HE provision maintained or improved from AY11/12 levels
• Successful launch of the annual student support application cycle
• An agreed Communications and Stakeholder Engagement Strategy and Plan","To sustain the universal postal service for the benefit of all users by securing Royal Mail’s future through the introduction of private sector capital and associated commercial disciplines. 
This will be achieved through: 
i) delivering a sale of shares of Royal Mail within this Parliament;
ii) creating an employee share scheme that, as decided by Parliament, will lead to at least 10% of the company in employee ownership to drive strengthened employee engagement; 
iii) delivering a financial outcome for the taxpayer, which when considered in the context of the overarching policy objective, represents overall value for money.
","A shared service solution for the BIS network will:  
- deliver a structural reduction in the cost base;
- provide simpler, transparent and more integrated processes across the BIS family of organisations; and
- secure continuous cost and process improvement through innovation and the application of a professional business focus.

Shared services enables wider business transformation. Greater benefits will be realised as the service matures beyond transactional services to higher value ones. There are opportunities for shared services to support:
- strategic procurement with effective compliance – managing the >£1bn contract expenditure of BIS and partners much more effectively, to deliver savings that could dwarf those from consolidating transactional services
- real benefits from Clear Line of Sight – so that rather than being an initiative about consolidating end-year accounts, it can underpin strategic management of BIS and its partners with timely, accurate, valued and well-aligned financial management information","The SLC Transformation Programme supports the Coalition's programme for Government.   The objectives of the programme respond to a number of challenges including the  reforms introduced in the White Paper ""Students at the Heart of the System"". Over the next three years the SLC anticipates major increases in student numbers, and loan values and volumes.  The student experience at present is very poor, due to operational and technology issues including lack of availability of complete case information and the time delay between the issue of evidence by students to the completion of the application process at times of high demand.  Due to the limited technology update over the last few years the current system needs replacement.  A robust and agile customer-centred student finance system is required.   Introduce a modern, integrated and flexible IT system to enable the safe delivery of HE reform (including changes to borrowers’ repayment terms including variable interest rates).
• Enhance customer service and operational efficiency.
• Support the transformation of SLC’s business through introduction of a unified technology platform and the standardisation of processes.

Expected benefits:

• Improved customer experience: easier access to real time information, additional communication channels and a reduction in incomplete calls, etc;

• Operational efficiencies:  increased process automation, reducing avoidable contact and standardisation of workflows; 

• Strategic fit: alignment of the programme with Government ICT strategy as well as with the strategic direction taken by SLC.

• Financial benefits to Government: ensuring HE reform-related savings, agreed as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review, are realised; potential for increasing the value of the loan book and an increase in the recovery of student debts;

• ICT efficiencies: introduction of a unified business technology platform, the use of standard technology and the ability to use more agile development approaches","HM Government is  carrying out a programme of asset sales with the purpose of reducing public sector net debt (“PSND”). The Government has announced intentions to sell the pre-Browne Income Contingent Repayment (ICR) student loan book to contribute to this objective and to realise value to the taxpayer.  This loan book will be sold in a series of tranches over a number of years.  The first tranche of loans is expected to be sold by 2015-16.  As is normal with transactions of this type, there will be a value for money assessment made before each sale. Each sale is required to meet the value for money assessment as well as other key project objectives to be considered a success.  Failure to meet objectives will result in a decision not to sell.

","The Government has adopted a policy of asset disposal where there is no longer a good case in public policy terms for continued public ownership.  On that basis, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), with commercial advice and support from the Shareholder Executive, are taking  forward preparations for a sale of HMG’s one-third shareholding in Urenco, a uranium enrichment company.  A sale could realise significant proceeds which have, in part, been earmarked to capitalise the Green Investment Bank in 2014/15. The project was transferred to BIS (in the Shareholder Executive) through a Machinery of Government change in February 2013. 

","To Introduce loans for those aged 24 or over, undertaking provision at Level 3 and above from 2013/2014. The project will allow savings to be realised through the conversion of grant to loan funding while still allowing access to advanced and higher level provision . Introduction of loans should put greater power into the hands of learners, creating a more responsive system. System should be simple and non-bureaucratic , representing good value for money and making use of HE infrastructure to minimise disruption and facilitate progression.                                                                                                                                                                                                    ","In September 2012 the Government announced the creation of a business bank to address long-standing structural gaps in the supply of finance to SMEs and mid-sized corporates. The bank, which has been allocated £1bn of Government funding, will be tasked with supporting the development of diverse finance markets for business, tackling market failures in the provision of finance, and ensuring that businesses are aware of and can access the support provided by Government.

The new institution will operate through the wholesale markets in order to unlock institutional investment to benefit small to medium sized businesses; it will not have any retail presence. Rather, it will facilitate the provision of loans, including long-term patient capital, to UK firms through banks and other financial institutions. The 'Business Bank' will be the single public identity and centre of expertise in government on all commercially-minded finance schemes for small and mid-sized businesses. These services will be managed as a single portfolio with operational and budget flexibility.

The bank will commercially-focused, employing finance, investment, business and public sector professionals to pool the expertise of the relevant markets and efficiently build up and manage the bank's operations. It will be able to determine its own priorities, subject to high level objectives, budgets and operating principles set by Ministers. The 'Business Bank' will not seek to replace or compete with existing and future finance providers, but rather to ensure that there is a greater range of providers and products on offer to businesses. By harnessing the power of capital markets, it has the potential to transform business finance in the UK.","Direct, targeted, government incentives for business led R&D and knowledge transfer is provided via the BIS sponsored Technology Strategy Board, through a wide range of economically robust business support interventions. Catapult technology and innovation centres will complement these approaches, by providing a business led, capital intensive infrastructure, that enables business to exploit new and emerging technologies, by providing a capability that primarily operates, at Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 7, bridging research and technology commercialisation, de-risking the process for business. ","The National Cyber Security Programme (NCSP) was put in place as a consequence of the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), with a budget of £650 million over 4 years.  Its aim is to deliver a transformative programme to give the UK a strategic advantage in cyber security and resilience.  The programme is managed by the Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance (OCSIA) in the Cabinet Office. 

With the agreement of Treasury as part of the latest Spending Review, the programme has been extended for a fifth year to 2015-16, with an additional £210m funding. ","Britain is in a global race – and to compete we need a world-class, 21st century Civil Service, capable of delivering a more balanced economy, a fairer society and the best public services.
To help the Civil Service change to meet these challenges, we launched the Civil Service Reform Plan in June 2012. We then reviewed the progress made and updated the actions in the Civil Service Reform: One Year On report, published in July 2013. 
The Civil Service Reform Plan sets out a series of specific and priority actions to tackle long-standing weaknesses, build on existing strengths, and address the frustrations expressed by Ministers, civil servants and the public alike.  
The Plan sets out the priorities for action now – and is the first stage of the continuing programme of reform. ","The Electoral Registration Transformation Programme will speed up implementation of the Individual Electoral Registration (IER) to tackle electoral fraud and improve the integrity of the electoral register. This will include legislation to bring forward implementation of compulsory IER to 2014, ahead of the next general election. Instead of one person filling in the annual registration form and including everyone's details, individuals will be expected to complete their own details and give supporting information - i.e. a national insurance number. There will be an element of 'confirmation' during the transition stage. Ensuring that the electoral register is as full as possible (i) will lead to increased democratic participation; (ii) gives a “voice” to local people leading to a legitimate political mandate; (iii) assists local people by supporting identification and residence, and (iv) is used as a basis for the collection of national statistics.                          ","The NGSS Strategic plan (published 28 Dec 12) defines five centres for shared services, which accounts for all central government departments with the exception of FCO who are working on a separate international model but are still integral to the programme.  
Strategic goals: Create and operate a Crown Oversight Function (COF), to provide governance structure to monitor performance of all Shared Service Centres (SSCs) and Dept retained functions; Work effectively with DfT and DWP to create two Independent Shared Service Centre solutions (ISSCs), which will operate independently from any customer organisation, and work with targeted Depts. to transition current services to one of these two solutions; provide oversight, sharing of best practice and benchmarking facilities to those Depts. where it has been agreed they can remain stand alone (MoD, HMRC and MoJ). Ensure a lower cost ERP solution is available as part of the ISSC solutions, reduce dependency and cost on the current dominant ERP providers,  remove barriers to entry for smaller Depts. and organisations by reducing software and maintenance costs.
The Programme and strategic goals will be delivered by four component projects: 
1. ISSC 1 is based on the DfT SSC in Swansea and has been divested to arvato. This is now in the process of being novated to Cabinet Office. ISSC1 will include a Low Cost ERP platform for smaller Depts. NOTE - DfT divestment (basis for ISSC1) is subject of a separate GMPP report
2. ISSC2 will build out of DWP SSC, working in partnership with DEFRA, EA and BIS and is currently going through a commercial procurement to deliver a JV partnership – this is due to complete in October 2013.
3. Crown Oversight Function is monitoring performance of all SSCs and Dept retained functions. Performance monitoring is being undertaken through centrally agreed benchmarks at both organisational level and process level for HR, finance and payroll. The COF will also include reporting benefits for the NGSS programme; 
4. Single Operating ERP Platform Project (SOP). A key objective of the NGSS Programme is to consolidate ERP solutions and deliver standard processes across central govt depts. Central govt has a large portfolio of Oracle ERP implementations which require some form of upgrade to Release 12 and Govt has an opportunity to consolidate a number of solutions on to one Oracle Platform.

","The purpose of the programme is to manage the successful delivery of the new pension arrangements against published timetables
Critical success factors:
• New arrangements will be implemented from 1/4/2015 and arrangements will be in place to implement additional changes post 1 April 2015
• Administration system, associated processes and all scheme documentation will be updated to be compliant with final regulations, enabling the scheme administrators (MyCSP Limited) to effectively manage members’ benefits under the new scheme in line with SMB Contract requirements
• All members and prospective members will understand how they are affected by the new scheme, based on regular, clear and effective communication. Where members are able to choose when they transfer to the new scheme, members will have had  sufficient information to make a choice
• All members will be in the correct scheme
",To create a secure Public Services Network comprising a network of networks built to common standards that enables the delivery of public services from any place by any provider; in doing so it will create a competitive marketplace to significantly reduce the cost of telecommunications services and enable different ways of delivering public services.,"National Citizen Service (NCS) is a flagship government programme that gives 16-year-olds the chance to learn new skills and get involved in their communities. NCS promotes:
• a more cohesive society by mixing participants of different backgrounds;
• a more responsible society by supporting young people’s transition into adulthood; and
• a more engaged society by enabling young people to work together to create social action projects in their local communities.

NCS brings young people together from different backgrounds (e.g. religious, ethnic and socioeconomic) to work together, and teaches them what it means to be responsible and serve their communities. It is a high quality personal development programme that gives young people a chance to prove to themselves and their peers what they can do. 

NCS builds on a substantial range of government initiatives that aim to increase voluntary activity among young people and develop their life and citizenship skills. Such initiatives include the National Young Volunteers’ Service , the Millennium Volunteers programme, and Volunteering Together. 

NCS is also part of a broader agenda of improving services and outcomes for young people between the ages of 13-19, reflected in the Positive for Youth policy statement published in December 2011 as well as drawing inspiration from international programmes such as the Americacorps, a programme developed in the United States that supports volunteering and engagement in social action .","Implementing the Government Cloud, CloudStore (formerly the Applications Store) in order to make procurement simpler, cheaper, faster and to help enable meeting targets for increasing procurement with SMEs","DCLG wanted to take advantage of a break in legacy IT contracts in August 2013, The legacy supplier service contracts had already been extended to the end of its original OJEU and the IT estate was up to 7 years old and required updating.
• The service includes circa 3,000 desktops across 20 offices and 50 key business applications.
• DCLG reformed its Arms length bodies (ALB), including merging the Planning Inspectorate and Infrastructure Planning Commission. By March 2013, the staff numbers covered will be expected to reduce by 30% and more modern flexible technology was required. 
.
The key objectives of the project are to:
• Ensure continuity of service replacing the functions of the current Steria and Verizon contracts when they expire in February-August 2013
• Improve efficiency through a shared services model which enables PINS and (with options for other Arms Length Bodies, such as the HCA to join as and when appropriate).
• Maintain flexibility by not tying the group into an arrangement which would preclude our ability to join emerging shared Government IT solutions.
• Support DCLG by aligning IT with the Departmental Business plan, the wider HM Government IT Strategy including and DCLG Group Shared Services Programme. 
• Improve the overall quality of ICT service provision to meet changing DCLG Business needs

"," Disband the Audit Commission and refocus local audit on helping local people to hold councils and local public bodies to account for their spending decisions by: (a) Developing and implementing a new audit regime where all such audits will be regulated within a statutory framework, with oversight by the profession and the National Audit Office; and (b) Transferring (through outsourcing) the Commission's in-house audit practice into the private sector","The Enterprise Zones (EZ) Programme is a key part of the Government’s wider plans for local and national economic growth. The 24 Enterprise Zones offer businesses financial incentives, fast track planning and superfast broadband  to support the creation of new jobs and business. 
Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) are the key agents overseeing the development of the zones. Delivery is  taken forward by varying local partners depending on the exact circumstances of the zone. In the majority of cases, local authorities are closely involved in delivery as will relevant land owners and developers.     
Relevant government departments are working closely with LEPs and other local partners, supporting them to unlock barriers to development and successfully deliver development.  
Since January 2013, the Government has taken a more hands-on approach to manage the programme to ensure no zone is without development by 2015.  Each zone has a detailed action plan in place which sets out key actions for LEPs, EZs and Government departments to take to accelerate progress by 2015.
Programme aims:
• to support successful delivery of the 24 EZs so that they create new (net) additional jobs and businesses and contribute to net additional local and national growth. 
• to drive progress in each zone to ensure no Enterprise Zone is without development by 2015","To ensure the rapid roll-out of broadband across the country in support of economic growth, including in rural areas.","
The SCCP aims to invest £150m in 22 UK cities to provide them with the digital infrastructure capability they need to remain internationally competitive and attractive places to invest, visit and do business.  The programme will do this by: helping Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) deliver economic growth through faster and better broadband connections (primarily through a connection voucher scheme); supporting the UK’s cities to procure commercial wireless coverage and/or Wi-Fi hotspots in public buildings; and helping cities to develop innovative technology projects to demonstrate the benefits of cutting edge connectivity to increase take up of services","To make the 800MHz and 2.6GHz spectrum bands available, by clearing existing users and holding an auction for new licences, for the competitive provision of next generation wireless broadband services across the whole of the UK as soon as practically possible (extending across as much of the UK as possible by end 2013), with minimal restriction, whilst appropriately mitigating and managing the risk of harmful interference to neighbouring spectrum users.  To deliver SCAP within the SCAP budget set by Government","The project aims to create more space to welcome people and to create a wide range of high quality social spaces where people can congregate relax and reflect. To place learning at the heart of the institution and to open visual learning to different audiences in a range of spaces available to accommodate the increasingly wide range of works in the Collection. To create a new public route across the Turbine Hall open 12 hours a day, linking the City of London and river walkway with the heartland of Southwark. To transform Tate Modern's setting and its relationship with the locality through transforming the public realm and landscape to the South and West. The building will be a model of environmental sustainability, setting new benchmarks for museums and galleries in the UK. ","The World Conservation & Exhibitions Centre (WCEC) is a £135 million project to provide 17,000 square metres of space within the Museum for exhibitions, conservation, scientific research, logistics and storage.  It has been designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners. The WCEC will ensure the Museum maintains its position as a leading institution for the study of human culture, in London, the United Kingdom and the World. Through an upgrade of key facilities, the development will address urgent needs in terms of the BM’s infrastructure and will provide a new exhibition space, state-of-the-art conservation and science laboratories and studios, world-class accommodation for the study collection, as well as facilities to support the BM’s extensive UK and international loan programmes. It will allow the BM to enhance the visitor and exhibition experience, lend more artefacts and most importantly continue to preserve the collection for future generations.","MIP is intended to  provide economic growth through delivering a sustainable solution for people living and working in areas with no mobile coverage.

The Mobile Infrastructure Project has been estimated at providing economic benefits of between £375m and £860m.

Government committed in 2012 budget to provide coverage to up to 60,000 premises and 10 key roads in Not-Spots.

Government will pay the infrastructure capital costs and all four Mobile Network Operators will provide state of the art coverage from the sites, as well as paying to operate them over the twenty-year life of the project. ","The Green Deal programme aims to promote a step change in the delivery of energy efficiency measures, supported by private capital.  The new market framework and Energy Company Obligation will help to meet legally binding carbon budgets, support seasonal energy security, tackle fuel poverty and help consumers reduce energy bills over the long term.  The programme is designed to remove financial and quality assurance barriers for consumers, stimulate demand and encourage companies to energy the market for energy efficiency in buildings.","In terms of the objective of the procurement, this has been established to be the delivery of a series of outputs largely based on the extant baselines of Magnox and RSRL and currently defined as outcomes of the Magnox Optimised Decommissioning Plan (MODP). This is subject to minor variations, mostly in terms of the timing of some of the key deliverables, some being drawn forward in time, while others are moved back to prevent foreclosure of potential strategic options for the NDA. The performance obligations associated with delivery of this objective are being embodied within a Client Specification which will ultimately form the basis of the contracts which are placed. Via the application of competitive tension, it is anticipated that a target cost incentivised pricing arrangement will be put in place for delivery  of the performance obligations of the contract at lower  cost than is currently planned. A key enabler to achieving this will be NDA's ability with the concurrence of HMG, to put in place a quantum of planned assured funding which will support competition.","The New Nuclear Programme aims to ensure that the framework is in place to enable operators to build and operate new nuclear power stations in England and Wales from the earliest possible date. There are four main elements to the programme:

1. Delivering the ""facilitative actions"" to which Government committed in the 2008 Nuclear White Paper.
2. Ensuring that all necessary actions are taken to enable the construction of the first new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C, by working with and through others (within DECC and externally) to help secure for example generic design approval, planning permission, CfD negotiation, state aid, helping current investors secure additional equity and direct negotiation of the arrangements for decommissioning and waste management.
3. Creating the environment in which nuclear operators can finance and successfully deliver a significant nuclear programme in the UK of around 16GW by 2030.
4. Creating the environment in which the UK supply chain can compete effectively to secure a significant proportion of the new build work in the UK and export into the world nuclear market.","The rationale for the RHI is to help meet the Government’s renewables target which requires 15% of energy to be sourced from renewable sources by 2020 in a cost-effective way and to help lower carbon emissions.  The Renewable Energy Strategy published in 2009 suggests that a 12% contribution to achieving the target could come from the heat sector. The Renewable Heat Incentive provides financial support to renewable heat generators and producers of biomethane that is designed to help address the additional cost associated with renewable technologies, in order to incentivise their take up.

","The Government's vision is for every home in Great Britain to have smart electricity and gas meters by 2020. Smart Meters will give consumers up-to-date information about how much gas and/or electricity they have used in pounds and pence, as well as units of energy.  Smart meters will have benefits for consumers, suppliers and energy networks. Consumers will have near real-time information about their energy use, enabling them to monitor and manage their energy consumption, save money and reduce carbon emissions.  Switching between suppliers will also be made simpler. Energy suppliers will have access to accurate data for billing and will be able to offer a wider range of services and tariffs.  Energy networks will have better information to manage and plan current activities and support the move towards the development of a smart grid. ","The Electricity Market Reform White Paper set out the Government’s commitment “to work actively with relevant parties to enable early investment decisions to progress to timetable wherever possible, including those required ahead of implementation of the Feed-in Tariff with Contracts for Difference (FiT CfD)”. To deliver this commitment, DECC will enter into discussions with relevant developers with a view to considering what form of comfort might be given to support the taking of such investment decisions.  The FID Enabling project gives effect to this commitment.

By providing an appropriate form of comfort in advance of the implementation of EMR reforms, we are likely to encourage final investment decisions to come forward that would otherwise have been delayed until all necessary legislation had been enacted and new institutional arrangements put in place; or possibly cancelled altogether.  This supports the Government’s decarbonisation and security of supply objectives as well as stimulating investment which creates jobs and growth.  

The first developer to seek assurance through the FID Enabling project, and whom we have accepted meet the criteria, is New Nuclear Build Generation (NNBG), a subsidiary created by EDF Energy to build a new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point C. NNBG will not move to a final decision to proceed with construction in the absence of additional certainty on expected revenue in the reformed market. A delay until the enduring regime is in place could substantially increase costs (ultimately principally borne by the consumer) or result in EDF abandoning the project. Either of these outcomes risks setting back the rollout of new nuclear generation as a whole, because the other developers are waiting for EDF to bear the first-mover risks.
","The Electricity Market Reform White Paper set out the Government’s commitment “to work actively with relevant parties to enable early investment decisions to progress to timetable wherever possible, including those required ahead of implementation of the Feed-in Tariff with Contracts for Difference (FiT CfD)”. To deliver this commitment, DECC will enter into discussions with relevant developers with a view to considering what form of comfort might be given to support the taking of such investment decisions.  The FID Enabling project gives effect to this commitment.

The aim of FID Enabling for Renewables is to avert an investment hiatus in the deployment of renewable electricity generation caused by the announced reform of the electricity market, in the period between the publication of the EMR White Paper and the full implementation of the EMR CfD, expected in Autumn 2014.   In particular it seeks to enable developers to take final investment decisions, or other critical investment decisions directly impacting on the time to commission the project, which would otherwise be delayed by the uncertainty caused by the transition to the enduring CfD regime.

The project aims are as for the EMR CfD: to ensure that the UK can attract the investment in renewable electricity generation needed to meet its renewable and carbon emission reduction targets in the most cost-effective way as well as to have a secure, affordable, supply of electricity towards the end of this decade and in the longer-term.

Supporting investment decisions through the project will contribute to two of DECC’s priorities:
• Deliver secure energy on the way to a low carbon energy future
• Drive ambitious action on climate change at home and abroad
It will also contribute to wider Government objectives on jobs and economic growth.
","The CCS Commercialisation Programme aims to build confidence and drive down costs of developing a cost competitive CCS industry, by supporting practical experience in the design, construction and operation of commercial scale CCS with £1bn Government capital funding and support under Electricity Market Reform. As a result of the CCS Programme existing fossil fuel supplies (gas & coal) will be used more cleanly, maintaining the diversity of our fuel mix; emissions from electricity generation will be reduced; in addition to providing a flexible and predictable supply of low carbon electricity generation, that can respond to changes in demand. For more information, see:

","The objective of the procurement was to secure a reduction in the cost and time to take Dounreay site to its interim end state by securing a new PBO for the Site Licence Company (SLC) at Dounreay, Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL). Associated with this was to be replacement of the cost re-imbursible Management and Operations contract with a Target Cost/Incentivised Fee contract which transferred elements of risk currently held by NDA/HMG to the private sector. The then plan reflected the cost at £3.5BN and being achieved by 2038. The terms of the contract notice required achievement of the interim end state by 2032 with a maximum annual cost of £150m. The successful bid (by BDP (Babcock Dounreay Partnership)) reduced the cost by circa £ 1 billion and brought the interim end state date forward to 2023-2025 although developments during the bidding process which the tenderers could not allow for due to their maturity are yet to be factored in via approved change control."," The aim of the programme is to undertake the necessary reform to the electricity market to ensure the UK can attract the investment in electricity generation needed to have a secure, affordable supply of electricity towards the end of this decade and in the longer-term and to meet its renewable and carbon emission reduction targets in the most cost-effective way.  The key elements of the programme which will deliver this are:                                                                             • The creation of a Contract for Difference Mechanism which incentivises low carbon technology and generation (renewables, nuclear and CCS) in a cost-effective way;
• The creation of the Capacity Market Mechanism to ensure that the market has sufficient capacity to ensure security of supply in a cost-effective way and 
• Putting in place an institutional framework with sufficient credibility to administer the reforms efficiently and effectively.","To deliver a solution for the safe and secure long-term disposal of higher activity radioactive waste for legacy and future nuclear waste.  The 2008 Managing Radioactive Waste Safely (MRWS) White Paper set out geological disposal as Government's favoured policy solution.  The Geological Disposal Facility (GDF) programme is designed to implement that policy.  Key parts of the programme include gaining community agreement to investigating the potential for hosting a GDF; completing site identification and assessments; securing legal and regulatory approvals and underground construction and testing to achieve the first waste emplacement by  around 2040.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Voting by local authorities in west Cumbria on 30 January 2013, on whether to participate further in the siting process for a GDF, did not result in the positive vote at both  Borough and County levels required for the process to continue in west Cumbria. Therefore, the current MRWS process has been brought to a close there. DECC Ministers have agreed that  the department will conduct a review of  the MRWS siting process, including lessons learnt from how the MRWS process operated in west Cumbria.  Following the review, when any changes required to the siting process are agreed, the GDF programme will be re-baselined and planning assumptions will be reviewed.    The information presented in this return in respect of the new siting programme - particularly the milestones -  is indicative and therefore subject to revision and confirmation.

While not a key dependency for the Plutonium Management programme, options for future management of plutonium are dependent on the availability of a GDF to provide a final disposal solution.       ","The Thames Tideway Tunnel project aims to underwrite the extreme risks which may arise during the building by the private sector of a new sewage tunnel under London.  
Population growth, increased urbanisation and changes in rainfall patterns mean that London’s sewerage system, largely built in the late 19th century, is operating close to capacity and as a result discharges of sewage to the Thames are occurring regularly and not just as exceptional events. This is unacceptable on environment and health grounds. The proposed Thames Tideway Tunnel is the most cost effective, comprehensive and timely solution to address the problem of combined sewer overflows into the Thames in London, and is due for completion in 2023. In principle the duty to build the £4.1 - 4.2bn Thames Tideway Tunnel falls to Thames Water (who lead the project) and oversight of customer interests falls to Ofwat. As lead Department, Defra is responsible for the regulatory regime for the water sector and is exposed to the risk of fines arising from an ECJ (Court of Justice of the EU) case, which has found the UK in breach of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive in London. If the project requires some form of  government support to enable the capital markets to finance the Tunnel then Defra is the lead Department to manage the risks to the taxpayer. Defra is working with Ofwat, Infrastructure UK and HM Treasury to ensure the costs of this large and complex project are minimised and it is delivered with a structure and financing mechanism that delivers value for money for Thames Water customers and UK taxpayers.","The Thames Estuary Programme Phase 1 (TEP1) is part of a long-term flood prevention programme for the Thames estuary to protect the 1.25 million people who live and work in the Thames flood plain in and around London. 
It forms part of  the Environment Agency’s Thames Estuary 2100 (TE2100) Plan which provides a strategy for protecting London and the Thames Estuary from tidal flooding to the year 2100 and beyond.  This is work to maintain and improve the existing system of flood defences, including the Thames Barrier and associated gates. The cost of maintaining and improving these defences is justified by the high value of assets protected, with  £200bn of property at risk.  
The TE2100 plan sets out the Environment Agency’s short-, medium- and long-term programmes of investments and other recommended actions to manage tidal flood risk through to the end of this century and into the 22nd century.  The Plan is based on a managed, adaptive approach which ensures that the right investments are made at the right time allowing for adjustments to be made in timing of works on the actual impacts of climate change.  The TE2100 Strategic Outline Programme (SOP) describes the delivery of the programme through a number of phases, and was approved by Defra and HMT in 2012. 
Now that the TE2100 SOP has been approved, the focus has moved on to the business case for the first package of works within that strategy - the TEP1 project. The scope of this is a proposed contract with a private sector partner to deliver a 10-year programme of the capital works, currently estimated to have a value of £314m, plus set-up costs of circa £5m.","The CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) Delivery programme aims to deliver a new IT and operational system to pay over £2bn each year of CAP funding to landholders.   The primary objective of the Programme is to procure a solution for the processing, payment and accounting of claims for funding from all schemes as part of CAP2013. Pillar 1 (Direct Payments and Market Measures) is administered by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) and Pillar 2 (Rural Development Programme) is delivered across RPA, Forestry Commission (FC), Natural England (NE) and the Rural Development Programme for England Team (RDT) in Defra. The secondary objectives are to develop and implement a strategy for the legacy systems and schemes, ensuring that scheme year 2013/14 can be completed properly and scheme year 2014/15 can be supported; to enable the satisfactory transition from current solutions during the 2014/15 scheme year; and finally to meet the remaining audit requirements. It will facilitate options for organisational change in the medium term for the Delivery Bodies that administer CAP schemes. The Programme will focus on (i) identifying the preferred solution for the future CAP schemes covering both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2; (ii) procuring the preferred solution in time for the implementation of the reformed CAP; and (iii) successfully managing transition for customers from existing schemes and delivering an improved customer experience aligned with HM Government digital strategy. ","On 24 May, the Secretary of State confirmed that the Priority School Building Programme (PSBP) would rebuild, or meet the condition needs of 261 schools.   The Priority School Building Programme will address the needs of 46 schools through private finance, with the remaining projects being funded through capital grant. 

To ensure value for money for the public sector, the 261 schools have been grouped together in “batches” to make projects that will be commercially attractive and drive strong competition.  

Four specific objectives have been agreed
• to prioritise schools (primary/secondary/sixth form) for rebuilding;
• to build more for less;
• to improve the future private finance model drawing on learning and experience from recent Building Schools for the Future (BSF) PFI deals, the HM Treasury review of operational PFI contracts, and Public Accounts Committee recommendations in response to the National Audit Office report; and
• to use a centralised procurement model for the  programme in order to drive efficiencies in procurement time and ensure that a quality solution is obtained at the lowest cost.","Building Schools for the Future (BSF) was conceived as a programme to rebuild or refurbish every secondary school in England. Projects were prioritised not according to the maintenance needs of schools buildings but according to the levels of deprivation and educational attainment in each area. It was originally announced that the programme would be complete by 2015; however this was later extended to 2023. The original estimated cost of the programme was £45 billion but this had risen to £52-55 billion shortly before the cancellation of the programme. Although originally planned as a 15–20 year programme, it was announced by the Secretary of State for Education on 5 July 2010 that only projects that had achieved OBC approval by 1 January 2010 would continue.   

Since the decision was taken to allow only those projects beyond OBC by 1 January 2010 to continue, an exercise was undertaken in late 2010 to identify savings from the remaining programme. C.£250m was duly identified as efficiencies.
","The project aims to establish sustainable air services to St Helena to promote economic development and increased financial self-sufficiency, leading eventually to graduation from UK budgetary support. 

This will be done through the construction of an airport and the introduction of scheduled air services.  The project also includes support to the operation of the airport for a period of ten years and the construction of a wharf.  The project will put in place the necessary legal, regulatory and monitoring framework, and includes a series of reforms to be implemented by the St Helena Government to open up the island to inward investment and increased tourism.","Intercity Express Programme (IEP) will replace Britain’s fleet of high speed trains on the Great Western Mainline and the East Coast Mainline. The Class 800 & 801's will   provide new, high quality, modern, higher capacity trains across the Great Western route between London, Bristol, Cheltenham, Worcester, Cardiff and Swansea and on the East Coast route between London, Leeds, Crewe and Scotland.                              

IEP's objectives are to: deliver increased carrying capacity on the rail network; deliver a faster reliable journey time; meet customer requirements by providing an enhanced passenger environment; improve safety; deliver an environmentally sustainable solution; minimise whole-life, whole-system costs; offer flexibility of deployment and; to manage the transition between the Train Service Provider and existing Intercity fleets.

The new trains will deliver significant benefits for rail passengers who will experience faster and more comfortable journeys. Capacity improvements of up to 40% into Paddington and 28% into Kings Cross and  journey time savings of around 23 minutes to Bristol and 18 minutes to Edinburgh are planned.

The first IEP trains will enter service on the Great Western Mainline  in 2017 and on the East Coast Mainline in 2018.


","The Crossrail programme will deliver a new high-frequency rail service and supporting infrastructure for London and the South East.  A key part of this is the construction of twin tunnels, each 21km long, through the heart of Central London. When it opens (in stages from 2018) Crossrail will run from Reading / Heathrow in the West to Shenfield in the East / Abbey Wood in the South East. Crossrail will create economically-vital new transport infrastructure to support London’s growth, delivering faster journey times and providing an uplift in rail-based transport capacity. It will put an additional 1.5 million people within 45 minutes of London’s business centres, facilitating employment growth of up to 30,000 jobs by 2026 in Central London.","The £6.5bn Thameslink programme will deliver faster and more reliable journeys for people and businesses and improve accessibility to, from and through the heart of London. 

In particular, it will reduce crowding on current Thameslink and other commuter services; provide for the introduction of new cross-London services; reduce the need for interchange between main-line and London Underground services and hence reduce overcrowding on the London Underground; and improve the reliability of train services operating through the core route section between London Bridge/Elephant and Castle and St Pancras. Thameslink will also offer interchange with Crossrail services at Farringdon once both services have been introduced.

When complete Thameslink will link  Sussex, Kent and Surrey with Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire via 24 trains an hour in each direction through central London at peak times. 

The Thameslink Programme is comprised of three main elements:  changes to Network Rail’s infrastructure, including extending of station platforms and significant redevelopment of Farringdon, Blackfriars and London Bridge Stations; procurement of new Depots and Class 700 trains with automatic train operation and new signalling through the core; and the setting up of franchise arrangements (under the new Thameslink Southern Great Northern – TSGN - franchise) for running the passenger service on a new combined Franchise network that will become the biggest franchise in the UK.


","As part of the Office of Rail Regulation's Periodic Review, Government is required to publish a High Level Output Specification (HLOS), setting out information about what the Secretary of State wants to be achieved by railway activities during Railway Control Period 5 (1 April 2014 to 31 March 2019); and a Statement of Funds available (SoFA), setting out the public funds that are or are likely to become available to secure delivery of the HLOS.  This fulfils the statutory obligation required by paragraph 1D(1) of Schedule 4A to the Railways Act 1993 as modified by the Railways Act 2005.

","To manage the delivery of UK SAR-H contract for the provision of a Search and Rescue Helicopter service to cover the entire UK search and rescue region. The UK SAR-H contract will replace the current Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) contracted service, which runs to June 2017, and the existing MOD capability which is due to end in March 2016 when the Sea King fleet is due out of service. The UK Government is committed to a number of international agreements which require a national framework of search and rescue resources to be available within a geographically defined region, currently the service is jointly provided by the MOD at 8 bases and the MCA at 4 bases. The UK SAR-H programme aims to deliver the UK SAR-H service from 10 bases. The benefit of the service is to save lives.","HS2 is the Government project to build a new North-South railway.  The case for the new line rests on the capacity and connectivity it will provide. We need this capacity because in the future, as our economy and our population grows, we will travel more. We need the connectivity because bringing people together drives economic growth. Our current transport system is already under strain and a constraint on growth. Among the many alternatives that have been considered – including new motorways and upgrades to the current rail network - HS2 is the best way of getting ahead of current demand on our core transport network. 

The new north-south railway is a long term solution to a long term problem. Without it the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main Lines are likely to be overwhelmed. With it, we will transform intercity travel, radically improve commuter services into London and our other major cities and increase the amount of rail freight. 

These transport improvements will help support economic growth and make a major contribution towards rebalancing the economy.
The new railway will be built in two phases. It will be fully integrated with the rest of the railway network. It will bring benefits to places with stations on the new railway including Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and London; to stations on the classic network like Liverpool, Darlington and Newcastle which will receive high speed services; and to other places on the existing mainlines like Milton Keynes, Rugby and Peterborough which will have better services from released capacity on the existing main lines


  

","The Shared Services Implementation Programme (SSIP), is a programme of work resulting from the successful conclusion of the Shared Services Futures Project. The latter project orchestrated the procurement and contract award (in February 2013), for the divestment of the former DfT Shared Services and the future provision of back office shared services functions to the Department for Transport (including its Executive Agencies). 
Following a procurement process, three preferred bidders were chosen in late 2011 and Competitive Dialogue started in February 2012. Dialogue concluded and final tenders were received, evaluated and a preferred bidder announced in December 2012. The Full Business Case was approved by the DfT Board Investment & Commercial Committee (BICC), Ministers and HM Treasury. On 28 February, the contract was awarded to arvato (part of the Bertelsmann Group). DfT completed the divestment exercise on 1st of June 2013
The SSIP is also a key deliverable for the Next Generation Shared Services Programme (NGSS) which is managed by the Cabinet Office. This Programme is focused on the centralisation of transactional functions for Finance, HR, Payroll and Procurement into 2 Independent Shared Service Centres (ISSC).Divestment of the DfT SSC will form ISSC 1 (June 2013). There will be a phased migration of DfT Business Units to the Provider's new solution, with all Business Units on the new system by October 2014.
","Following the consultation on the local strategy, Delivering Quality Healthcare for Hertfordshire (DQHH), the decision was made to develop a new hospital facility in Welwyn Garden City. The preferred solution identified in the business case is the provision of a designed for purpose New QEII in Welwyn Garden city on part of the current site of the existing QEII Hospital.  The new facility will provide a range of care (including a local A & E), diagnostic, and outpatient services supporting the strategic vision of DQHH. The New QEII  is being procured through Assemble, the South East Midland LiftCo. The scheme is a key component of the DQHH strategy enabling the consolidation of acute services in East and North Hertfordshire onto the Lister Hospital site in Stevenage. ","The TIME Project is a multi-phased £130m project which will eventually deliver approx. 285 mental health beds in four/five sites across North Merseyside. Phase I comprises a new 85 bedded unit on the old Walton General site (£25m) and an 85 bedded unit also in Liverpool (£27m).  The Phase I buildings are being procured under the NHS LIFT Initiative in conjunction with Liverpool and Sefton Health Partnership (LSHP).   Phase II will follow but may be procured via other routes.   The new accommodation will be single room en suite with access to outside and therapy spaces.  It will replace functionally unsuitable accommodation currently based on a number of disparate sites.  This will release significant land for sale. The two Phase I schemes have now been designated for separate Financial Close, with Edge Lane/Old Swan expected to be at least one year behind.  Financial Close for Walton was achieved in February 2013.  This return covers Phase 1 only.","The programme previously called Chrysalis evolved under the HPA from a new build on the Porton site to co-location of Porton elements (research, health protection services, and corporate services), Colindale and NIBSC on a single site in the vacated GSK Science Park at Harlow. HPA’s Chrysalis Programme  focused on the urgent re-provision of the ageing, high security, high containment specialist microbiology laboratories at Porton Down that are a key part of the nation’s defence against novel and dangerous microbiological pathogens such as pandemic flu, Ebola, anthrax and many others. 
The programme  transferred to Public Health England (PHE) on 31st March 2013. An independent due diligence review carried out for  PHE supported the continued investigation of Harlow and allowed PHE to adopt Harlow as the preferred option for the OBC. The vision under PHE is currently being developed and will build upon and strengthen the strategic case for an integrated public health service. This will look at the creation of a new integrated centre operating as the “apex of a pyramid” of the PHE national network for local public health services and facilities, supporting the entirety of the new public health system;
-  The best model for delivery of specialist national public health functions, looking at the benefits of colocation and virtual networks;
- The benefits for public health that can be realised by the creation of a new integrated centre across all three domains of public health – including the benefits to the model for improving the public’s health and reducing inequalities;
•-The national leadership and international global health impact that results from an integrated centre;
- The contribution to the national Plan for Growth through its work on innovative public health solutions and specialist translational research by creating opportunities for “wealth creation” and links to the life sciences strategy;
- Working with industry and academia;
- Working with the developing National Laboratories Strategy;
- Future proofing the proposals so that the vision is flexible and can respond to the new requirements and economic environment in the future.

The proposed PFI facility has a capital value of approximately £90m and will include:     - Adult Acute inpatients (49 beds); - The London Spinal Cord Injury Centre (38 inpatient beds); - Children and Young People's Services (37 beds); - Therapy areas for all three inpatient service areas; - A new main entrance; - Inpatient and complex imaging.  The new Healthcare Facilities will deliver improvements to clinical adjacencies, forming a main entrance 'hub' in the centre of the existing site, thereby commencing a process of site rationalisation that will deliver improved patient outcomes including: Improved privacy and dignity for patients as the project will deliver 100% single rooms for adults; Improved utilisation of beds as the single sex agenda and infection control will be easier to manage; Improved access to Imaging as the department will be planned to meet current and future activity and changes in technology; An attractive and modern environment to attract and recruit world-class professionals to train and work at the Trust;","A new Royal Liverpool University Hospital to be procured under the Private Finance Initiative. The scheme will address service delivery and building infrastructure concerns. It will secure the future provision of high quality service for the local population, together with specialised services for Cheshire, Merseyside and beyond and support world class research and teaching in partnership with the University of Liverpool. This will be achieved through the implementation of a Clinical Services Delivery Model, the development of services outside hospital, redeveloping or utilisation of facilities at Broadgreen Hospital and redeveloping the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. The existing hospital also presents a significant business continuity risk arising from serious issues concerning fire safety and the engineering structure.","The development of a new acute hospital on a brown field site in the Grove Lane area of Smethwick (in Sandwell) to replace the current Sandwell General and City Hospitals, as part of the wider changes to health and social care within the health economy being undertaken in the Right Care, Right Here Programme. This will result in a major shift of care away from the acute hospital into community settings, major investment in new community and primary care facilities and the state of the art new single-site acute hospital proposed in the OBC. 
Since DH approval of OBC , SoS has authorised use of compulsory purchase powers and the site has been acquired.  PF2 procurement programme under development.

The new hospital will provide a total of 234 beds (210 commissioned, 24 decant) in 10 new wards and 6 existing wards in an adjacent unit built in 2003.  It will also provide two support buildings: an entrance building to control all access/egress for the site and a central building to house all off-ward activities and administration.  The programme includes the realignment of the site boundaries and the sale of surplus land/buildings to support programme funding.",This is the fourth and final stage of the Our Changing Hospitals Programme which will enable full consolidation of all acute services onto the Lister site in Autumn 2014.  The programme is at the heart of the organisations strategy and addresses a number of clinical and financial challenges:- allowing us to achieve best clinical practice and improve outcomes and productivity; providing the means for our response to the challenging economic conditions through QIPP; create a mass of clinical and specialist staff to sustain a wider range of high quality services and introduce new technologies; facilitate modernisation of our facilities and improve patient experience whilst enabling reductions in estate and related costs through reshaping the QEII site; to offset the income loss and support the revenue consequences of the capital investment on the Lister site.,"The aim of the project is to consult with subject matter experts on the feasibility of pre-pandemic vaccine and its effectiveness and, dependent on the outcome, procure further pre-pandemic vaccine to replace the existing stock that will expire in 2013.","Background:  Rotavirus infection is the commonest cause of gastroenteritis in children under five years of age worldwide.   Rotavirus infection in the UK is seasonal, occurring mostly in winter and early spring.  In England and Wales an estimated 130,000 episodes of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis occur each year in children less than five years and approximately 12,700 of these children are hospitalised.  In 2011, following consideration of a peer-reviewed modelling study, JCVI advised that the licensed rotavirus vaccines would have a significant impact on reducing gastroenteritis in young children, and that the Department should introduce a rotavirus immunisation programme if the vaccines could be procured at a cost effective price.  Following negotiations with the manufacturer, the price paid for rotavirus vaccine resulted in the vaccination programme being cost effective.  The Department of Health has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution, to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective.
Objective:   The overarching objective of the rotavirus immunisation programme is the reduction of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis in England.   
Scope:  The scope of the project is limited to England and includes all the elements required to successfully deliver a rotavirus vaccination programme.  
Benefits:  The programme will deliver: (1) rotavirus immunisation for babies added to the national immunisation schedule; (2) a reduction of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis; and (3) a reduction on the burden on the NHS by reducing hospital admissions and visits to GPs caused by rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis.
 Rotavirus immunisation has been introduced as part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule from 1 July 2013 and is being delivered via GPs alongside the other vaccines for infants.

","To identify solutions for shared transactional services for finance, procurement, HR and Payroll. To gain agreement from all bodies to adopting those solutions and facilitating their implementation. The programme will close in March 2014 by which time the decisions on the service solutions will have been taken, contracts agreed and implementation plans will be in place. The programme will put in place governance arrangements which will facilitate the individual implementations in each stakeholder organisation.","Background:  Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the chicken pox virus in a person with a dormant chicken pox infection.  It is not known what causes the virus to reactivate but this is usually associated with those with a suppressed or less effective immune systems.   Shingles incidence is highest in older people as the incidence of shingles increases with age; in the UK it is estimated to be around 790 to 880 cases per 100,000 people, an estimated 30,000 cases of shingles per year for people aged 70 – 79 each year.  In 2010, JCVI advised that a universal shingles programme should be implemented for people aged 70 years and up to 79 years inclusive if a licensed vaccine was available at a cost effective price.  The Department of Health (DH) has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution, to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective.  Shingles vaccination will be introduced as part of the arrangements for delivering routine immunisations to adults. NHS England will be responsible for commissioning these services and will need to decide on the most appropriate arrangements for securing delivery as per the service specifications supplied by Public Health England (PHE).
Objective:  The overarching objective of a shingles vaccination programme is the reduction of shingles and associated sequaelae in England.
Scope:  The scope of the project is limited to England and includes all the elements required to successfully deliver a shingles vaccination and catch up programme.
Benefits:  The programme will deliver: (1) sustained improvements in public health; (2) a reduction in burden on the NHS by reducing the need for treatment and (3) a cost effective health intervention.
Maturity:  The Shingles vaccination will be introduced as part of the arrangements for delivering routine immunisations to adults.  The indicative start date for the programme is 1 September 2013, with the vaccine being given alongside the seasonal flu vaccine for the routine 70 year old cohort.   There will also be an annual catch-up programme offered to specified co-horts, commencing with 79 year olds in year 1 of the programme, 78 year olds in year 2, 77 year olds in year 3 etc. This pattern will continue until those eligible for the vaccine between 70 – 79 are offered the vaccine. This delivery model is based around current vaccine supply.  The catch-up programme could potentially be implemented quicker if vaccine production increases from 2016","The objectives of the Transition Programme are to:
• Modernising the Health and Care System such that it will deliver Secretary of State’s vision as set out in the NHS and Public Health White papers.
• Deliver the structural changes to the system on time and within the programme budget.
• Ensure the transition of activities from the old system to the new system occurs smoothly, including the closure of entities and transfer of appropriate accountabilities.
• Ensure the future system runs within the cost envelopes set out within CSR.
• Ensure the health and care system maintains operational and clinical performance and emergency preparedness throughout the transition.","In its 2010 Coalition Agreement, the Government committed to increasing the number of health visitors by an extra 4,200 FTE by April 2015.  Ministers want that extra capacity to bring with it the ability for local teams to improve public health outcomes for the under-fives, with health visitors having the time to provide parents with critical health and development advice, and to connect families to the array of health and wider community resources that help them to give their children the best start in life.  

As part of the Government’s Health Visitor Programme, a commitment was made to improve the quality of services offered to parents and families in the early years of a child’s life.  It has been shown that high quality early intervention, prevention and support is vital to giving children the best start in life. The expansion of the health visiting service is intended to:
• improve health and wellbeing outcomes for under-fives
• reduce health inequalities
• improve access to services
• improve the experience of children and families.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 
The programme has faced a major governance challenge in 2013/14 with the creation of the new health and social care system. Responsibilities for delivery of the programme’s aims are now split across three key organisations: DH; NHS England; and Health Education England. This has meant recasting the governance and PPM arrangements to reflect Mandate responsibilities and the complex relationships. As the programme has moved into its key expansion and delivery phase, more focus has also been placed on preparing for successful handover of commissioning (as part of 0-5 children’s public health) to Local Authorities later in 2015. A multi-agency task and finish group has been established to plan and deliver the transfer.","The Electronic Transmission of Prescriptions (ETP) Programme is delivering the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS), which is a national service, and the aim is for this to operate in all GP practices and pharmacies in England.

With 1.6 million paper prescriptions generated every working day in England and a predicted annual rise of 5 per cent, the EPS provides an alternative means of generating and processing the growing number of prescriptions.

The NHS Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) enables prescribers, such as GPs and practice nurses, to send prescriptions electronically to a dispenser (such as a community pharmacy or dispensing appliance contractor) of the patient’s choice. Dispensing contractors can subsequently send electronic reimbursement endorsement claims to the NHS Prescription Service. The main aims of the ETP programme are:
o To enable the electronic transmission of prescription data in England between:
     - Prescribers (GP, nurses, supplementary)
     - Dispensing contractors (community pharmacy, dispensing doctors and dispensing appliance contractors)
     - The NHS Care Record Service
     - Reimbursement Agencies (e.g. the Business Services Authority’s NHS Prescription Services)
o To facilitate the efficient, convenient and accurate dispensing of medication to patients. The scope of the programme covers all primary care prescribing and dispensing (excluding Schedule 2 and 3 controlled drugs) and supply of medicines, drugs, appliances and chemical reagents by authorised dispensing contractors. Secondary care prescriptions issued for dispensing in the community are also within scope
o To enable the NHS Prescription Service to re-engineer their processes to increase capacity and reduce the unit cost of processing prescriptions.","The objectives of the proposed investment in a replacement for GPSoC are:
-Establish commercial and management arrangements for GP IT that facilitate an open and informed market over the life of this investment.
-Support delivery of efficiency savings in General Practice by facilitating better use of existing GP IT and by implementing more mobile health technology over the life of this investment.  
-Introduce IT functionality that responds to the evolving needs of patients, practices and commissioners and the wider NHS.  
-Improve security of patient data by providing practices with the option to migrate to centrally hosted services over the life of this investment.","The purpose of the BT LSP (London) Programme is to support IT enabled transformation in the NHS in London to create a more efficient, joined-up and patient-led health service. The key objectives of the programme are to: 
- Provide patients with more choice and control over their patient records
- Create a health service centred around the patient with health information following patients where they are receiving treatment
- Provide health professionals and patients with better access to information and enhance the quality of clinical information so that decisions about patient care and treatment can be made quickly and efficiently based on secure and up-to-date healthcare records.
- Help health professionals deliver better patient care by improving the way NHS staff connect  with each other across organisational boundaries and provide them with faster, easier access to reliable electronic patient information 
- transform the way information flows around the health service and help to provide improved and innovative patients services in London.
This will be achieved by delivering modern IT systems and services to the NHS in a flexible, efficient and effective way to enable trusts to tailor solutions to support local needs and priorities. 

This contract lasts until 31 October 2015.","This project is about the provision, development and implementation of a new NHS e-Referral Service (NHS e-RS) to succeed the existing Choose and Book service in line with NHS e-RS vision and a significant broader set of strategic drivers.
The vision positions the new NHS e-Referral Service as a flagship programme to support paperless referrals and a paperless NHS by 2018, and as a centrepiece of NHS England’s response to the Government’s Digital First and transparency initiatives.
The NHS e-RS project has the following scope.
• Drive toward paperless referrals with necessary business change
• Launch of new NHS e-Referral Service vision and sustained period of communications and stakeholder engagement
• Software development, including:
   o Initial stage software development to re-platform

Further, NHSmail provides a national relay service which enables NHS organisations in England, Scotland and Wales to communicate. SMS (text) services provided are used extensively by NHS organisations with over 4.8 million SMS messages sent each month. Services are centrally funded and are currently free to NHS Organisations at point of use.

NHSmail is a fully operational and successful programme. Demand for this service remains strong. High user satisfaction ratings and strong support from the National Stakeholder Engagement Group and National NHSmail Forum suggests a desire to continue a secure email service for the NHS in some form. The continuation of a need, along with a number of other key infrastructure projects, was confirmed in a DH announcement on 22nd September 2011. 

The existing NHSmail contract was executed on 1st July 2004 for a 9 year term which is now due to expire on 30th June 2014 with the recent contract extension. The currently contracted supplier for this service is Cable & Wireless Worldwide. 

The aim of the NHSmail2 project is therefore to identify a solution and replace this existing service, with the new service being phased in throughout 2015.

The project is working with the Crown Commercial Service to set up and run a Managed Email Framework which will be available to the wider public sector. The OJEU for this was released on the 20/02/14, the framework being able to be procured from on the 30/06/14.

The Project will run a further competition on suppliers which are on the framework to select an NHSmail supplier. This is currently scheduled for the 02/10/14.

The SMS element is being procured via the G-Cloud framework, with a view to SMS being devolved to local procurements and funding in March 15.","CSC LSP Delivery Programme is the programme responsible for the implementation of digital health care records service in the North, Midlands and East of England. This programme is being delivered by CSC (Computer Sciences Corporation) as the Local Service Provider (LSP).

The CSC contract consists of a number of Strategic Products aimed at different healthcare professionals working across multiple care settings.  Where these Strategic Products were not sufficiently developed to provide all of the required functionality and benefits associated with them at the time required for deployment, a number of Interim Products were made available to NHS organisations for implementation.  The Products will replace outdated legacy systems and manual processes for the capture of clinical information, enabling a number of benefits to providers, including; reducing the reliance on paper based process, improving safety of care and increasing operational efficiency and effectiveness.  These Strategic and Interim Products will remain for the duration of the contract:

* Strategic Products: • Lorenzo • TPP SystmOne • Medusa Emergency Care System (ECS)

Currently, N3 gives pervasive access to health to a range of national applications and N3 services such as VOIP and Video Conferencing and is fundamental to NHS service delivery. The deployment of a future WAN on the expiration of N3 (currently March 31st 2014) is essential for ensuring health and care is able to deliver services and quality care to patients. Furthermore, the information sharing needs across the public sector are growing exponentially.

This investment will deploy a compliant Public Services Network for Health which will not only ensure interworking within health and care but also between the wider public sector. This will also enable access to the legacy N3 infrastructure during transition which will ensure health and care can transition from N3 to PSNH without loss of service, it is envisaged transition will last up to 3 years.

The specific objectives are:

• To underpin the Information Strategy by permitting the flow of electronic information between health and social care organisations.
• To comply with government policies for the use of shared services.
• To recognise and support health and care providers’ choice in their ICT by enabling devolved infrastructure procurement.
• To facilitate a private network that meets information security standards.
• To enable flexible communications infrastructure.
• To provide continuity of Service
","The Summary Care Record supports patient care by providing healthcare staff in urgent and emergency care settings with the essential medical information they need to support safe treatment. The SCR includes a defined set of key patient data for every patient in England except those who choose not to have one. The over arching aim is that the SCR will contain only significant aspects of a person’s care, those deemed to deliver benefit to a patient when receiving urgent and emergency care. 

When a patient’s SCR is first created it will contain details of: Medications; Adverse reactions; and, Allergies from the patient's GP record. 

Patients have a choice to opt out of the SCR at any time and must give permission for clinicians to view their SCR. To support this, a SCR public information programme involves making patients and NHS healthcare staff aware of the SCR. This includes sending a personalised information pack to all GP registered patients, over the age of 16. ","The South Acute Programme was established by the Southern Programme for IT Board in Autumn 2011 to deliver clinical systems for Acute providers in the South of England that did not receive services from the Local Service Provider (LSP) contract.

This should be achieved by investing in services (Liaison and Diversion services) to screen, assess and refer offenders at the earliest possible point of the criminal justice system into relevant treatment and support, and that information from assessments is subsequently fed into the criminal justice process and can be used to inform decisions about justice outcomes, charging, prosecution and sentencing.  This fits with the strategic aims and objectives (offender rehabilitation to support reduced offending, and improved health and wellbeing outcomes) of each of the departments involved.  It is accepted by the Coalition Government that this direction of travel supports the business needs, as it was anticipated that early intervention and investment in health services for offenders across England will save money through reduced ongoing impacts on the criminal justice system.  Policy work is being taken forward by a cross government programme, funded through the SR settlement to DH and involving DH, Ministry of Justice and the Home Office, working with NHS England and Public Health England.  HMT has recently approved the Outline Business Case and trials of a standard service specification are due to commence in April 2014 (the programme is due to transfer to NHS England in March 2014).","Influenza is a viral infection of the respiratory system.  For some people, especially older people, young infants and people with underlying health conditions, it can cause serious even life-threatening complications and death. The impact of influenza on the population varies widely from year to year due to changes in the virus. However, one recent estimate considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisations (JCVI) suggest that each year, on average, approximately 0.75 million people may consult their GP, approximately 27, 000 people may be hospitalised and 4, 700 people may die in England because of influenza. Currently the programme provides influenza vaccination on the NHS for people aged 65 years and older and those aged under 65 with certain underlying health conditions (e.g. those with chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, pregnant women etc). 

JCVI has recommended that the current flu programme is extended to children aged 2 to less than 17 years. DH has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution , to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective. The evidence reviewed by JCVI suggests that the extension to the current seasonal flu programme might result in around a 40% reduction in the death and hospitalisation figures shown above across the population, although there is large uncertainty either way in this estimate.  For this reason, JCVI recommends that the impact and cost effectiveness of the extended programme be reviewed within five years of the introduction to assess whether the expected benefits have been realised.

When fully introduced this will be the largest immunisation programme offered in the UK, offering vaccine to more than 9 million children every autumn.  The programme is therefore being phased in to allow time to build up capacity and adopt learning from early pilots.
","The reprocurement and implementation of the ICT managed service capability for DH and its ALBs. IMS3 is a project, running a procurement against the ASCC framework to provide the next generation of agile ICT services to DH and its ALBs. The procurement completed in Dec 2011 and the delivery project ended in July 2013 following a transition phase from CSC to Atos IT Solutions & Services Ltd. The live service will then run for up to 5yrs.",The aim of the project is to re-procure the National Pandemic Flu Service to ensure that a complimentary service to primary care remains ready to be mobilised to enable the rapid distribution of antivirals to symptomatic patients.,"To develop a full PBT service in England that delivers the following aims and objectives:- 
1) ensure that all patients, for whom evidence supports PBT as the most clinically effective treatment, receive treatment within a clinically appropriate service specification and to nationally agreed standards. 
2) to ensure that services provided enable the continued development of the technologies involved and that workforce and training issues are appropriately addressed. 
3) to deliver improved outcomes by ensuring that patients have access to high quality modern radiotherapy techniques comparable to those used in other European countries, to improve patients' experience by minimising any long term side effects of treatment. In particular to :- 
a) develop a PBT service that meets the objectives as stated in the SOC December 2011 
b) oversee the facilities projects to ensure that the two sites develop a service that meets Commissioner's specifications to time and budget 
c) monitor the facilities projects financial governance arrangements to ensure that it delivers value for money 
d) manage the transition from an overseas service to a service in England 
e) identify and manage the impact of the PBT service on other clinical services 
f)develop a national clinical network 
g) ensure that a research strategy is in place that informs the future development of the service 
h) manage the impact of workforce across radiotherapy services. ","From April 2013, the Government introduced a cap on the total amount of benefit that working-age people can receive so that households on out-of-work benefits will no longer receive more in welfare payments than the average weekly wage for working households.     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Benefit payments for individual households are capped at £500 per week for couples (with or without children) and single parent households; and at £350 per week for single adult households without children. This is around the average earned income after tax and national insurance deductions for working households.
","The Government’s vision is that separated parents should be encouraged and supported to work together in the interests of their children and to set up their own, family-based child maintenance arrangements. For those who are not able to do this, the Government has introduced the 2012 Child Maintenance Scheme, administered by the Child Maintenance Service. The 2012 scheme delivers two critical changes to the policy and regulations which simplify the approach to child maintenance calculations, and provides a new IT platform on which to administer it. ","The Central Payment System (CPS) provides the Department with a fully integrated payment and accounting solution. It has brought significant improvements in the level of customer service, delivered the flexibility needed to support future methods of payment; and will provide opportunities to identify instances of fraud and official error.  It has also introduced significantly higher levels of resilience to our business, reduced dependency on aged systems, and delivered a flexible platform to meet future business needs.","The objectives of the Fraud, Error and Debt Programme are to:
• Save approximately £2.1 billion in welfare benefit expenditure by the end of 2014/15 financial year.
• Contribute to the Departmental target to reduce the level of overpaid benefit expenditure (the Monetary Value of Fraud and Error) to a maximum of 1.7% by 2015.
• Deliver further fraud and error controls across the benefit and credit systems that are fit for purpose to protect the integrity of the welfare system.
• Deliver a single fraud investigation service as a more efficient way of carrying out benefit fraud investigations currently processed separately by DWP, HMRC and Local Authorities.
• Deliver infrastructure which will support improved future delivery in DWP Fraud, Error and Debt Operations.
• Deliver an effective streamlined debt model for the Department that will enable Government to recover greater levels of debt, and ensure those who move off benefit can still be liable for their debt.

The Programme has adopted a phased delivery approach between 2012 and 2016 and will continue to build on the successful ""Spend to Save"" data matching activity which is well underway to ensure a sustainable reduction in losses in the benefit system. Since 2010, initiatives have generated savings in excess of £1.1bn and will realise further savings through the life of the Programme business case.
","This Project delivers the reassessment, through the Work Capability Assessment, of all relevant Incapacity Benefits customers, all those claiming Income Support on grounds of incapacity, and working age claimants of Severe Disablement Allowance to Employment and Support Allowance. Reassessment commenced in October 2010. The Project objectives are that: 
1) all IB customers gain from a new, simpler, more active benefit; 
2) everyone who could benefit engages with back to work support through the Work Programme; 
3) the right people are on the right benefit, and subject to the appropriate conditionality and help to return to work; and that 
4) all disabled people and people with health conditions are  treated equally over time, and receive fair levels of financial support; with 
5) administration on the same systems for all people on incapacity benefits, cutting down on error and dual provision; and 
6) a transfer to new systems as seamless as possible, with customers’ rate of payment protected as part of transition.
","Personal Independence Payment replaces Disability Living Allowance for people aged 16-64. Support is targeted towards those people who face the greatest challenge to remaining independent and participating in society.  It provides a more objective assessment of needs and is more responsive to changes in those needs.  PIP will be simpler to claim and to administer.
","This Programme implements the recommendations from the independent Sayce Review:
1. to invest more funding and improve the delivery and services available through Access to Work;
2. to move Remploy out of government control, seeking other entities to take over the running of businesses and services, and supporting ex Remploy employees made redundant as part of this process.","The white paper ""The single tier pension; a simple foundation for saving” set out the proposals for state pension reform on 14 January 2013: 

• introducing a single-tier State Pension set above the basic level of means-tested support;
• abolishing the Savings Credit element of Pension Credit for the single tier cohort;
• ending contracting out for Defined Benefit schemes;
• modernising of the delivery of Pension Statements; and 
• transforming Pensions delivery to be ""digital by default"" using Government Digital Services design standards.
","Universal Credit aims to reduce the number of workless households by reducing the financial and administrative barriers to work that exist in the current system of benefits and tax credits. It replaces the complexity of the income-related benefits system (Housing Benefit, Income Support, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, income-related Jobseeker’s Allowance, Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit) with a single payment which supports people to find work, find more work, and find better paid work.","The Government’s Coalition Agreement gave a commitment to ""create a single welfare to work programme to help all unemployed people get back into work"". The Work Programme, which has been in place nationally since June 2011, does this by providing an integrated package of back-to-work support for a range of claimants - from Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) recipients who have been out of work for some time, to claimants who may have received Employment Support Allowance (ESA) or Incapacity Benefits. 

The innovative features of the Work Programme include: 
1) Payment largely by results, for the first time 
2) A long-term focus – once a claimant is referred to a Work Programme prime provider, they remain with that provider for 2 years 
3) Differential pricing – payments up to £14,000 for getting those with the biggest barriers to employment into sustained work 
4) A process that is not prescribed – providers are given the freedom to innovate and use what works best.
","The Youth Contract builds on the support already available through Jobcentre Plus and the Work Programme and is worth almost £1 billion over its lifetime. At the core of the Youth Contract is: 
o 160,000 wage incentives worth £2,275 each, for employers who recruit an 18-24 year-old from the Work Programme; 
o an extra 250,000 Work Experience or Sector-Based Work Academy places over the three years, ensuring that there is an offer of a Work Experience place for every 18 to 24 year-old who wants one, before they enter the Work Programme; 
o at least 20,000 extra incentive payments worth £1500 each for employers to take on young people as apprentices; and 
o extra support through Jobcentre Plus for all 18-24 year olds, consisting of weekly, rather than fortnightly signing, extra advisor time to provide more back to work support; and a careers interview from the National Careers Service.
The Government is also making extra funding available for the Department for Education to support the most vulnerable NEET 16 and 17 year olds into learning, an apprenticeship, or a job with training. 
","The overarching aim of the Government’s workplace pension reforms is to get more people saving more for their retirement. The Automatic Enrolment Programme ‘went live’ in October 2012, delivering:   
1) Automatic enrolment - a new duty on employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme, and an incentive to remain saving in a pension scheme through a mandatory employer contribution.
2) The National Employment Savings Trust – to offer low cost pension provision to individuals on low to moderate earnings and their employers. NEST must accept any employer who wishes to use it to meet their employer duty. 
3) A proportionate compliance regime - run by the Pension Regulator to support these measures. 

The implementation period for the Programme runs to 6 years. Employers subject to the new duty are being 'staged' in by size, starting with the largest, over the period October 2012 to February 2018. Contributions to pension schemes will be phased in over time to provide a period of adjustment for employers and individuals, with full contributions being paid from October 2018. 
Once fully implemented, between 6 to 9 million people are forecast to be newly saving, or saving more, into a workplace pension.
","To provide fit for purpose and secure offices for the BHC in Abuja, Nigeria.  The existing Chancery and unclassified offices are located in split locations, both of which are rented and were opened in 1991 as a 'temporary' solution.   Since then Abuja has firmly become established as the administrative capital of Nigeria and it has been the FCO's intention for some time to have offices that are fit for purpose for the next thirty years, that comply with current FCO security standards and provide an effective platform for a wide cross-section of UK government departments.  Nigeria is one of the FCO's significant priority countries in Africa and presents a unique mix of threats and opportunities for UK interests.    The business case clearly shows that the way to achieve our medium and long term aims in Nigeria is by building new premises on the UK-designated plot leased in 1991 from the Nigerians.   It remains the case that the increasing clear and present danger to our staff working in the region is bringing intense pressure for the new BHC office scheme to be moved forward along an accelerated timescale.  ","Following the bombing of the Consulate General in Istanbul in 2003 a fundamental security review identified  Jakarta  as one of the most vulnerable posts in the estate. The FCO decided in 2004 to move to a greenfield site, which we acquired in 2009 at a cost of £7.56m. Both staff and visitors are at significant risk in a country with a proven track record of terrorist attacks on western interests (including Embassies). In October 2010 HMT approved an earlier FCO investment decision to  provide new offices at a cost of £29.5m. Mace  (FCO Strategic Partner) were appointed in Dec 10  under a Works Instruction (target cost £22.63m) to deliver the new offices. Following a delay in the local permit process work started on site in  June 11. Aim: to build safe and secure offices.

","The FCO wants to maximise the efficiency of its London estate by consolidating its core activities into the Main Building on King Charles Street (KCS). This will support the wider Cabinet Office strategy of consolidating the HMG Estate in Central London. It will free up the Old Admiralty Building (OAB) freehold for other Government Department use. There are significant savings for the FCO on operating costs and for the wider Government on lease rentals. This UK Estates Reform (UKER) project is a catalyst to provide a more modern working environment for FCO staff, to help deliver Diplomatic Excellence, to embed flexible working, and to drive efficiency across the FCO. The FCO must also introduce a new High Classification IT system by 2014, which will involve making a significant part of the KCS building secure.","Echo is rolling out a new global network for voice and data services currently delivered through the FCO Telecommunications Network (FTN) to FCO Overseas Posts.  It will also replace the Managed Telephony Service (MTS) delivered to FCO sites across the UK. The Programme also caters for other members of the UK Government's Overseas Community, delivering a sharable service whereby the FCO provides the 'platform of choice'. The Echo Programme will make a substantial contribution to delivering the FCO’s ICT Strategy and, in turn, support Diplomatic Excellence, which is the FCO’s reform and modernisation programme.","The One Click Programme of work is made up of 6 projects; Start-up hub, the Tax Dashboard, the Online Tax Registration Service (Registration Wizard), iforms, Transaction Monitoring and VAT Registration Transformation. One Click brings many Tax services (CT, ITSA, VAT and PAYE) that businesses need together in one place, online. Focuses on key events in a business' lifecycle, with information for pre-start ups, a single place to register for business taxes and a self serve facility to view and update details online.

(N.B., the iforms project has now moved into the Digital Solutions Portfolio.)","The Organised Crime Project will have a significant impact on the Organised Crime segment of HMRC’s Customer-Centric Strategy.  The key aim is to prevent, disrupt and reduce deliberate, systematic and large scale attacks by Organised Criminal Groups (OCGs), estimated to cost HMRC between £5bn to £7bn per annum. The threat from OCGs is evolving and we need to prevent significant attempted fraud just to maintain losses at their current level. The project will deploy approximately 500 FTEs across a range of new and established interventions to target organised criminals including; joint working with the Border Force (BF), the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and expanding our Fiscal Crime Liaison Officer (FCLO) Network to increase cooperation with foreign administrations. We are also an instrumental part of the Cross Government Strategy to tackle Cyber Crime. We aim to address the threats at each stage of the illicit ‘supply chain,’ improving capabilities in intelligence, civil and criminal investigations. The Project is structured to address the main threats which come from VAT Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC), repayment and registration fraud, diverted alcohol products and cigarette and tobacco smuggling. 
During 2012-15 we will change our approach to organised crime to target the key individuals behind the fraud using new intelligence gathering methods 
and new technology capabilities that will support this approach.","Use of SR10 reinvestment monies to increase the capacity and capability of trained tax professionals and operational people engaged in tax compliance work, and widen the range of approaches and interventions they use. To use reinvestment funds of £553m to deliver £6.66b benefits by increasing capacity in Enforcement & Compliance (E&C) and building its capability by shifting resource into high risks including evasion.  This will be achieved using HMRC's Customer Centric Business Strategy.  The outcome will be more resource focused on tackling risks in the rule breakers and potential rule breakers segments using new and innovative ways to settle those risks.  The project has six distinct strands:
1.  Redeployment of additional resource within Local Compliance & Risk & Intelligence Service to evasion and other risks - Local Compliance will be the recipient of the majority of the Wider Coverage reinvestment resources to increase its capability and capacity. Rick & Intelligence Service will grow also as a consequence to feed Local Compliance's increased needs for risk assessments. 
2.  Specialist Investigation Redeployment - as a result of the increase in capacity and focus on tackling evasion and non compliance SI has launched   .
a unit to tackle off shore evasion.
3.  Tackling evasion risks through E&C Taskforces - the programme will deliver the resource capacity and capability to tackle rule breaking and 
evasion by establishing E&C Taskforces.
4.  Tackling risks through campaigns - the programme will fund additional staff so that the number of campaigns launched over the SR period will 
increase.
5.  Tackling risks through pre-return Business Records Checks - this will address the problem of poor record keeping at source using a pro-active 
approach. 
6.  Tackling recidivism through the managing the Serious Defaulters Scheme - E&C intends to put additional effort in monitoring rule breakers 
post intervention.

Current HM Treasury approval status is at FBC. The Programme FBC has been given full approval by HMRC Investment Committee. The HMRC 
Treasury Approval point for the FBC took place on 20 November 2012.","This investment of staff represents the continuation of our existing operations, but increases the resource deployed on debt collection by 909 FTE over the proposed SR10 reduced resource baseline. Benefits are calculated against the SR10 reduced resource baseline as the counterfactual.  
Investing staff back into our more efficient and effective debt collection model results in additional receipts in the consolidated fund of £1108m over the SR10. 
Even with this investment, DMB will deliver a 9% net FTE reduction across the SR10 period as well as the additional receipts detailed above.
The majority of investment (£56.3m) is paybill with a small amount of capital and resource to enable the transfer of staff into DMB. Operational planning with this investment scenario has demonstrated no scale up costs elsewhere.","HMRC is revising its approach to tackling fraud in the Rule Breakers customer group, increasing the number of criminal investigations and subsequent prosecutions in this group. This approach is called Volume Crime and will: deter rule breakers and potential rule breakers from fraudulent behaviour; enhance the effectiveness of civil interventions by evidencing the downsides of non-compliance; and show HMRC is relentless in pursuit of those who break the rules.  The Volume Crime project aims to significantly increase productivity and resources deployed to criminal investigation. 240 staff years will be deployed as a result of this project in Criminal Investigation and associated Risk and Intelligence Service functions, with prosecution numbers rising through the SR10 period to an additional 1,000 prosecutions delivered per year from 2014/15. The considerable increase in activity in the rule breakers segment increases the perceived risks to potential rule  breakers and thus deters individuals from going down the path of tax evasion and therefore an increase in ""voluntary compliance"" due to the deterrent effect. 
The project is currently creating a research programme to measure this deterrent effect.",Real Time Information is the next stage of improving PAYE through the use of real time information.  It will deliver a series of projects to implement measures designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the PAYE system.  This will underpin the introduction by the Department for Work and Pensions of the Universal Credit regime.,"This investment to extend the use of Debt Collection Agencies  represents a continuation and expansion of our existing operations.

- Underpinning digital capability that will provide HMRC with the capability to respond at pace to change, including the introduction of iforms
- New IDA process through PAYE Online and our Corporate solution for business customers ","In May 2010 the coalition Government pledged to “implement the Parliamentary and Health Ombudsman’s recommendation to make fair and transparent payments to Equitable Life policy holders, through an independent payment scheme, for their relative loss as a consequence of regulatory failure.” The Equitable Life Payment Scheme was set up as quickly as possible, so that those who had suffered losses as a result of maladministration were finally able to receive redress. The Government’s stated ambition for payments to begin by the end of June 2011 was met. Payment volumes started to ramp up in November 2011 and the Scheme moved to full operation in 2012. By September 2013 the Scheme had made payments to the value of c£734 million to c548,000 policyholders.","In a world of internet enabled communication, to ensure that the police, wider law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies can lawfully obtain, manage and use communications data and intercepted content to: detect, prevent and disrupt crime; protect the public and save lives.","To provide ongoing contract provision for accommodation and transport services to eligible asylum applicants throughout the UK beyond the arrangements which expired in 2012 with improved terms and conditions, whilst maintaining value for money.

","IABS built a central biometric capability to replace the Immigration and Asylum Fingerprint System (IAFS). IABS was required because the IAFS legacy system was 10 years old and running out of capacity.   IABS went live on 27 February 2012 and is fully operational.  A subsequent release, in April 2013, supported biometric verification with higher availability and greater resilience, and enabled the capability to hold fingerprint and facial watch-lists.

The new NIS contract can be terminated by service ‘tower’ and by month, to be replaced by FITS contracts for service towers, unless the contractor can demonstrate superior value for money during the remaining contract term. The delivery part of the new contract is now referred to as the NOMS ICT Services (NIS) Programme and covers the transformation of the current technology to the new infrastructure services.","The aim of the Prison Competitions Phase 2 Programme is to deliver the NOMS Agency Framework Agreement which includes a commitment to ensure that the organisation engages in effective and efficient commissioning practices that include the stimulation of market activity to assure best value is obtained through its delegated resources. Competition in prisons has been used to deliver multiple objectives: increases in capacity, value-for-money, service/performance improvement, productivity and innovation. Competition has led to service improvement by management teams motivated by competition.  Competition has also generated improvements in productivity, with flatter, leaner management structures, reduced sickness leave and a more mobile workforce.

The key benefits anticipated are:
• Significant cash savings, over the life of the contracts.
• Improvements in custodial services.
• Progress towards the strategic objectives set out in the Green Paper, including Working Prisons and Drug Free Wings.
• Bringing more bidders to the competition process.","The aim of the NOMIS Programme is to give prison and probation staff new and improved access to the information they need to manage offenders efficiently and effectively throughout the system - protecting the public and reducing re-offending. [The Programme is now delivered and has been closed].

NOMIS is five IT-enabled business change projects:

• Probation Case Management System (PCMS) - Replacing a variety of different systems with one centralised system for probation;
• Offender Assessment System Replacement (OASys-R) - Improved, shared system for offender assessment across both prisons and probation
• Prison-NOMIS - An improved, centralised prisons case management system now fully rolled out;
• Data Share System (DSS) - Enabling probation staff to access the core Prison-NOMIS information they need for effective offender management; and
• Inmate Information System (IIS) update - Improving functionality  ","The aim of the CJS Efficiency Programme is to introduce digital working throughout the CJS, in particular to deliver the ‘digital courtroom’. The current work will transform the operation of the criminal courts, with all parties able to work from digital devices and with evidence being presented to the court electronically; changes which will allow further streamlining of business processes. The digital court will enable a shift away from paper-based working so the system can operate digitally, where this is a more efficient process.

","The aim of the HMCTS Reform Programme is to:

• explore proposals for the reform of the resourcing and administration of our Courts and Tribunals;
• secure the revenue and investment necessary to modernise the infrastructure and deliver a better and more flexible service to court users;
• modernise and transform courts and tribunal services to increase efficiency, improve service quality and reduce the cost to the taxpayer;
• explore how we can further enhance the position of the UK at the centre of the international legal market and the revenue it can generate; and
• preserve the independence of the judiciary which lies at the heart of our constitutional arrangements.
","The aim of the Legal Aid Transformation Programme is to:
• reform remuneration in the shorter term; 
• tender crime contracts in the medium term; 
• increase the public credibility of the legal aid system
• ensure that the introduction of Universal Credit does not create an additional pressure on the legal aid fund.

In September 2013, the reforms were forecast to reduce fund spend by £220m pa by 2018/19. Since then, as a result of policy changes and updated data for Advocates Graduated Fee Scheme (AGFS) reform, the estimated savings has reduced to £215m pa by 2018/19.","The SOCA ICT MODERNISATION Programme (previously SOCA 'ISOT' (Information Systems and Operational Technology) Programme) has replaced multiple legacy ICT contracts with one contract in January 2011 with Logica (now CGI), which enables modernising to an effective, efficient, managed ICT delivery capability. ","NS&I provides the Government with access to retail finance that is cheaper than finance raised through the wholesale market.  Over the last four years, NS&I has delivered a positive VI benefit of £2.3 billion

In order to reduce costs and increase efficiency, NS&I’s operational services were outsourced to Siemens IT Solutions and Services (SIS) in 1999.   Now under Atos, the service is delivered by c. 1750 staff, of whom about 400 operate via a subcontract located at two sites in Chennai, India.  The Atos contract expires on 31 March 2014 and cannot lawfully be extended.

The purpose of the Yoda Project is to put in place arrangements to ensure that the Government has continued access to cost-effective retail finance compared with raising funds on the wholesale market beyond expiry of NS&I's current service contract with Atos on 31 March 2014.","Meeting current and new international legal requirements for National Accounts, through a series of stepped improvements","Design, build and deliver the 2011 Census and disseminate statistical outputs"," Developing systems, methods and processes to improve the collection, integration, processing and analysis of data about the UK economy",Building on the ONS website and delivering new services and functionality to continue to implement the ONS web strategy,Current phase - To recommend the best way to provide populations and small area socia-demographic statistics in the future,
Departmental commentary on actions planned or taken on the MPA RAG rating.,"MPA RAG rating as at 30 September 2013 was Amber/Green. The programme is well established and operates using tried and tested systems, processes and arrangements. Ministers are supportive of the programme and the sector is fully engaged.","The Amber/Green status reflects the good progress that has been made in terms of progress to time, cost and quality.  Good progress has been made on the on going transition element of the project. The MRC Monitoring Committee reviews progress at its monthly meeting.","GIB became fully operational in October 2012 following receipt of state aid approval. It has since made commitments of £1.3bn, and mobilised more than three times that amount in private capital. ",The Amber/Green status reflects that student numbers appear to be recovering this year after a fall in the first year of the new regime.  New regulatory requirements for alternative providers have been introduced to strengthen protections in the absence of primary legislation. The Programme is nearing its closure point and we are moving activities increasingly into Business As Usual. Action has been taken to ensure continued good governance to oversee risks and issues and stewardship of benefits realisation on a continuing basis.,"The Amber status reflects the view that the project was being managed effectively but significant external risks threatened successful completion - namely market conditions and industrial relations.  Extensive monitoring and contingency planning  were undertaken to manage potential risk materialisation, and a plan was put in place for decision-making and auditing of key decisions in the run-up to the sale of shares. Post-IPO the department has defined  the division of responsibilities between the policy and shareholder teams and  added measurement of benefits  to the ongoing role of the policy team. The project  closed in October 2013 and a lessons learned document has been  developed  which will include consideration of how the skills developed by the project team could be deployed on similar projects elsewhere within Shareholder Executive and more widely across Government.  ","The Amber status reflects  the challenges faced with the continued movement of partner organisations to the new service during Phase 1, and finalising the timetable for future BIS Partner Organisations involved in Phases 2 & 3.
In order to reduce the risk of delaying the on-boarding of clients (that have a higher level of readiness to others), a decision  was taken to develop individual business cases for organisations identified for inclusion in the latter stages of the programme. 
The programme remains fully resourced and achieved   go-live in October 2013.
","The Amber status reflected the requirement to have more detailed plans in place from Transformation Partners and programme work-streams. 
Detailed planning sessions are planned to l enable the development of a baseline delivery roadmap which will then be used to refresh the delivery plan , budget and team structures. This roadmap will continue to be refined. 
Resource capacity has been highlighted as a challenge - action plans are being put in place to manage this challenge. A resourcing governance process has been agreed, defined and implemented.
","Actions being taken to address the Amber/Red rating include the Project Steering Group assessing and confirming the delivery capability of key partners. Following agreement that the Go/No-Go criteria (required to continue with phase two of the project) has been met the Project will undertake work to further define its objectives, establish more robust plans, governance and project management disciplines, and appoint experienced external advisers to assist on the project.  ",Data exempt under section 27 and section 43 of the Freedom of Information Act (2000),"The Amber/Red rating reflected the fact that there were initially concerns that the loans payments system would not be launched on time and there were aspects of the system that had defects.  Whilst overall takeup of loans was strong at the time generally there were areas where take-up was very low, one being apprenticeships. Robust plans were put in place and contingencies used to ensure successful launch and rectify defects. It was also decided that apprenticeships be removed from loans. Due to both the successful removal of apprenticeships and launch the programme officially closed on the 24th October 2013.","A total of £660m of new financing reached small businesses in 2013 as a result of the BBB programmes - a 70% increase on the previous year.

We continue to engage with the European Commission and hope to receive state aid approval to enable the BBB to go live in Autumn 2014","The Green rating reflects good progress to date and steady delivery at Catapult centres including various stages from the establishment of new facilities, operations, engagement with businesses and development of R&D programmes. All seven Catapult centres were operational in 2013.  With the network maturing, the TSB is now ready to move the programme to a ‘business-as-usual’ activity and to start to establish the next phase of centres, Precision Medicine Catapult and Energy Systems Catapult.


","The programme devised a benefits management framework in 2013/14, and its successful implementation was reflected in the upgraded delivery confidence assessment.  Prior to this, the programme had made good progress on developing its governance and addressing some of the skills gaps in the programme team. The programme conducted a comprehensive health-check in the second half of 2013-14, to provide assurance that the programme was still closely aligned to its strategic objectives, and to highlight potential gaps and areas where potential effort should be directed.","From September 2013, the programme moved into tranche 2. The CSR Team undertook a process review over the summer to inform its approach to tranche 2, identifying areas for improvement and change, as we move into the different phase. Changes include: refining the governance, streamlining reporting processes prioritising programme effort and resources  accordingly, a new focus on departmental realisation of benefits and improving programme-wide risk and issues management. 

At a Programme level Civil Service Reform has had a number of key achievements since Q1, including the successful launch of the One Year On report and the ‘Be Exceptional’ Civil Service Live event, both in July. Also in this period a number of the Programme’s component Actions have moved through the Project Lifecycle to closure or are being embedded and translated into outcomes in Q2 .Further key milestones that have been achieved this quarter have been the completion of the first tranche of the Commissioning Academy, introduction of the CS High Potential Scheme, publication of the first edition of Civil Service Quarterly, launch of the Open Policy Making website in Beta, and the announcement of a new Commercial Model for government.   

Whist a number of issues and risks exist to the programme, these are being actively managed and do not pose an unacceptable level of risk to delivery of the programme.
","The programme has made good progress, particularly in regard to benefits realisation. The critical components of the digital service have been built, including the online application, local authority EMS functionality, DWP matching capability, secure transfer methodology between local authorities and the IER Digital Service. A plan for live service support has been adopted and is being delivered. The forms for IER have been designated and hardware requirements to support them identified and payments to local authorities for these are  underway. The programme is on track for 'go-live' in June 2014.  While a number of issues and risks exist, these are being actively managed and do not pose any major risk to successful delivery of the programme.","The programme has scheduled the ISSC1 on-boarding and 'go-live' timetable with a planned delivery date for the DfT Tranche 1 Migration of 1 July 2014, to ensure that the supplier's (arvato Ltd) hardware infrastructure is fully compliant with CESG accreditation.
The ISSC2 provider (Shared Services Connected Ltd) is working with customer organisations to ensure agreed services are delivered and a detailed Transformation Plan will be delivered by the end of April 2014. Business Assurance arrangements will also be in place by the end of April 2014. While a number of business and operational risks and issues exist across ISSC1 and ISSC2 these are being actively managed through more focussed and closer engagement with service suppliers and customer organisations alike and do not pose any major risk to successful delivery of the programme.","The 2015 New Pension Scheme Programme is part of a much wider Programme of Pension reform reporting in to HMT.  The estimated Programme costs which have been agreed and approved by the SRO and by HMT are £13.4 million over the Programme life. My CSP costs are monitored and scrutinised by the Programme and HMT.  Rigorous monitoring is applied to future  forecast spend which is agreed on a quarterly basis subject to SRO approval. The new 2015 pension scheme is being introduced as part of wider reform to public service pensions. The reforms are legislated under The Public Service Pensions Act 2013 and these measures are projected to save around £65 billion by 2061-62 (HM Treasury calculations based on Office of Budget Responsibility’s Fiscal Sustainability Report 2012). While a number of risks and issues exist these are being actively managed and do not pose an unacceptable level of risk to the successful delivery of the programme.

","Good progress has been made on improving the areas of the project related to Governance, Scope, Funding, Resourcing, Stakeholder Engagement and Communications, Compliance testing and approval, preparing for Business as Usual. The Governance issue, Scope and Compliance  have now been addressed. The funding issue will be closed out by the end of March 2014 which in turn addresses the resource issue. Stakeholder and Comms and preparation for Business as Usual are ongoing. BaU preparation expected to be complete by May 2014. While a number of risks and issues exist these are being actively managed and they do not pose a major risk to successful delivery of the programme.
","NCS  continues to be fully on track to achieve all of its outcomes following the novation of provider contracts to the NCS Trust in November.  The successful delivery of the Autumn 2013  programme by the NCS Trust further adds to programme confidence. Risks remaining for the programme relate to HMT approval of the 15/16 programme budget, ERG approval of the 14/15 marketing spend and commissioning of contracts for 2015 in late April 2015 for signature on October 2015.","G-Cloud moved to Government Digital Service (GDS) in mid-2013 as a transfer from project status to business as usual. At the time  when the project moved to BAU there were three areas of concern (1) the programme was not funded (2) the programme was under-resourced (3) there was not an agreed benefits realisation methodology. All of these were addressed . During the transition to BAU steps were being put in place to meet the original objectives of the project and realise the benefits. G-Cloud came off GMPP with MPA and HMT approval once it was understood what actions were taking place. The G-Cloud programme has been successful in achieving its aims to support the Cloud First strategy and increase sales to SMEs.  Sales at the end of April 2014 have reached £175m, with 60% by volume and value being with SMEs. The run rate for the last few months is averaging at £16m a month, suggesting an annual sales figure of nearly £200m.  There is a programme in place to increase the monthly sales figure further. 

There is a full-time team of 25 x FTEs to support both the existing GCloud programme and the new Digital Marketplace that will replace Cloudstore later this year.  A budget of £3.9m has been allocated for FY 2014/15 to support all GCloud activities including support to suppliers and buyers.  The Alpha of the new Digital Marketplace will be live shortly after Easter and the Beta by the summer recess.  An efficiency and benefit review was carried out at the end of January.  This demonstrated that GCloud sales show a saving of 50% when compared to how such services were procured previously.  A savings methodology has been agreed with NAO for capturing and reporting savings into the wider ERG savings reports. 

As part of the programme, we are making it clearer, simpler and faster for the whole of the public sector to buy digital products and services when it needs to.  We are helping create a pool of quality suppliers of all sizes, who work in agile ways, to supply and work with government.  We are doing this by:

Building the customer base 
Building the supplier base
Building the product catalogue
Making the processes easier for buyers and suppliers 
Building a new digital marketplace around user needs

The Amber/Red status reflects the fact that the Connection Voucher Scheme is breaking new ground as a demand led intervention. This makes it difficult to predict now the likely level of demand for vouchers among SMEs. 

The scheme remains on track to complete by 2015.","The key action was to clear and auction the spectrum which happened in Feb 2013.

The programme remained on track to deliver the appointment of the preferred bidders in the Data and Communications Company (DCC) and service provider competitions as planned. The competitions were viewed as well managed and quality assured throughout, with a strong culture of commercial leadership and programme control driving an experienced team towards clear goals. Stakeholder engagement was also noted as commendable.
In September 2013, following the DECC-led procurement, the Data and Communications Company (DCC) licence was awarded to Capita. The DCC then contracted with the successful data and communications service provider bidders to establish the shared infrastructure linking smart meters with service users.

On timetable:
A timetable has been developed for the passage of the hybrid Bill through Parliament based on our assessment of the number of expected petitions.  We deposited the Bill on time, achieved success at Second Reading and we are now working with Parliamentary authorities to ensure smooth passage of the Bill through parliament.
Contingency plans, based on different scenarios for the progress of the Bill through Parliament, have been developed. 

On transitioning to the next phase:
On 19 November 2013 SoS confirmed that HS2 Ltd will be the delivery agent for Phase 1. Following this decision we have made significant headway in putting in place the people and structures needed to enable construction to start in 2017. 
An integrated Programme Management Office is being created under the responsibility of the new HS2 Ltd Programme & Strategy Director. This will cover all aspects of the programme including DfT, HS2 Ltd and Network Rail. 
An initial draft of the Outline Procurement Strategy (OPS) for Phase 1 has been developed. Our strategy for supply chain management includes ongoing engagement with industry. The first HS2 Supply Chain Conference in Birmingham in November 2013 set out our OPS to the supply chain.
A programme of work is underway to get ready for construction. A Baseline Programme is in place (Baseline 3) and the HS2 Phase 1 Programme Execution Plan (PEP) has been initiated to define scope and identify key inputs to the document. A critical path for Rolling Stock procurement has been developed to ensure alignment with the programme. 

","The Shared Services Future Project became the Shared Services Implementation Programme (SSIP) after the DfT divested the Shared Services centre to arvato on 1st of June 2013. SSIP compromises the migration of the DfT agencies on to arvato’s new infrastructure, in two phases one in July 2014 and one in October 2014. The delivery confidence recognises the challenging timeline, the complexity of the programme and more importantly the challenges faced by the supplier in standing up its infrastructure. The SSIP board and team continue to monitor the supplier and delivery of the programme very closely. Despite considerable challenges, there remains a palpable desire and recognition from all parties that the overall delivery plan remains achievable.","The RPA overall score was low,  the complexity assessment summary was as follows - profile as medium, delivery challenge as low, capacity and capability as very low and scale as low","Following the DH Gateway review, further work was undertaken on the Benefits Realisation Plan, the Mobilisation programme, and also the reporting of progress to the Project Board.    The build is now approaching completion.",The programme has been liaising with MPA and cross-government reviewers on the programme. This has included sharing Programme Board minutes and risk/issue registers to provide assurance around the management of the programme. A Project Assessment Review(PAR) is planned for the next quarter to provide further assurance. This will be targeted on the specific objective of creation of a new vision for the programme under PHE and the ability to deliver a new OBC in the summer of 2014 and obtain a decision by the end of September 2014.,"There are no significant issues that threaten the success of this project. There is a delay risk relating to the approval of the Trust draft Appointment Business Case. This risk relates to the new NHS landscape, which has created a more time consuming commissioning intentions sign-off process.","The overall delivery confidence assessment is based on an internal project team view, against a background of a completed and implemented Gateway 2,  completion of Gateway 3 and progression of the procurement process, an approved ABC and identification of a Preferred Bidder Minded to Appoint. The project continues to receive high or significant assurance from the project's auditors.",Project recommenced 2013 after issue of Private Finance 2 (PF2) guidance. Internal Assurance Process completed 2013. OBC approvals underway. Gateway 2 is planned for the end of March 2014.,There is no formal RAG rating as NHS schemes are not RAG rated by the MPA.  The most recent Gateway Review of the scheme was in October 2011 (refreshed Gate 1).  All Gateway recommendations have been actioned in full.  One of the recommendations was that the next review would be a Gate 3 to be undertaken as the Full Business Case is being prepared for submission and approval (currently programmed for September 2014). This would be reviewed if the preferred procurement route and funding source in the OBC was changed or amended as part of the OBC approval process.,"Once, the main contractor had been selected for appointment the final part of the Gate 3 review was carried out on 4th/5th March 2013 by two of the same reviewers that conducted the Gate 2A review in September 2012.  The Delivery Confidence assessment was GREEN and key findings were:
                         
‘A thorough tender evaluation process has now concluded and the Trust are to be commended on the evaluation process that has led to a firm recommendation for the selection of a main contractor. The Trust has every confidence that the preferred contractor will deliver the new hospital on time and within budget utilising a collaborative approach as well as innovative design solutions.’

‘All stakeholders remain supportive and the Project Team are planning the next phases on the basis that the necessary approvals will be forthcoming. The Governance structure has been reviewed and further resources are being recruited. All major issues/challenges that could impact upon the Project appear to have been identified. We feel that this remains an extremely well run project and successful delivery appears highly likely subject to DH/HM Treasury approval.’",The Health Gateway Review 0: Strategic Assessment completed on 21 March 2013 resulted in an Amber/Green rating. The review concluded that the component projects are ably led with widespread engagement and is on target to deliver to time and budget. The review noted there is a need to make progress with the development and implementation of the workforce plans which is in progress invoving all projects and managed via a PMO process.,No departmental narrative,The RAG rating is  GREEN as immunisation started on schedule on 01 July 2013.,"The Business Case for DH and 12 other organisations to move to the Cabinet Office's preferred solution, ISSC1, (Independent Shared Services Centre 1) was agreed by Secretary of State in Autumn 2013. Since that time the supplier has been working closely with DH on their business critical requirements. This has resulted in a review of prices by the supplier which has cast doubt over the financial viability of moving to ISSC1 for a number of the bodies involved. The current position is that DH is working closely with the supplier and Cabinet Office to understand the drivers for the increased costs and the potential to mitigate them. At present unless prices fall the maximum benefit for Government as a whole will be derived by DH alone migrating to ISSC1 and the other organisations looking for alternative solutions. This is however subject to change as a result of the work currently being undertaken.","Project delivered on time and within budget with NHS/Providers being experienced in the delivery of new immunisation programmes.  There was a temporary delay with the supply of the shingles vaccine,                                                                                                                  Zostavax®, into the UK.   Supply was resumed in December 2013.  Preliminary data suggests, despite the interruption to vaccine supply, there is still good uptake in the identified cohorts.  ",The Transition Programme closed when it delivered the health and care reforms on 1 April 2013. Since this time there has been a Major Projects Review Group review which looked at the reforms post implementation. This review made a number of recommendations concerning the governance and management of future benefits delivery within the Health and Care System. The assurance of benefits delivery is now contained within the work of the Assurance Division within the Department of Health reporting to the Executive Board at regular intervals.,"The following mitigating actions are in place to ensure all is being done to deliver on the programme’s workforce expansion aim:
• a detailed analysis of the complex position between now and April 2015 of the key factors that will deliver service expansion: training intake; course attrition; trainee conversion rate to employment; participation rate in employment; net turnover (leavers); and other supply into employment,
• a menu of interventions to improve each of the factors above to maximise FTEs in the workforce (including an additional, final March 2014 training cohort),
• active performance management across the new system.

These actions are being further developed by NHS England at NHS Area Team and Regional level, reflecting the different challenges in each part of the country.

Delivery of service transformation is being assured through analysis and response to qualitative and quantative performance data. A formal baseline consisting of six impact/success criteria based on Ministerial health priorities will be in place by end-September 2014 so that delivery of service transformation by 31 March 2015 can be further assured.

The risks around the handover of commissioning (as part of 0-5 children’s public health) to Local Authorities later in 2015 are being managed by a multi-agency task and finish group which has been set up to plan and deliver the transfer.","A Combined Gateway 5 / Assurance of Action Plan (AAP)  (based on the Gate 0 of Nov 2012) was held in Jan 2014 at which the previous review's actions were revisited.  The key outstanding actions related to confirming funding for the project from April 2014, undertaking a forensic review of the business case, confirming whether a new business case was required and confirming how changes to scope would be handled in future. The responsible Programme Director has confirmed that  funding is in place. Outstanding actions are being tracked to closure providing the SRO with assurance of progress. The next assurance review is scheduled for July 2014.","All recommendations from the GPSoC Gateway 2 (Delivery Strategy) have been addressed which was acknowledged in the Gateway 3 Review (Investment Decision) undertaken in November 2013. The Gateway 3 Review identified a number of recommendations including risk management and contingency planning. All recommendations are in the process of being actioned.
","Although deployments are complex, significant additional functionality can be deployed before the end of the programme. 
A Programme Assurance Review occurred in February 2014 (joint between CSC and BT LSP Programmes). Its recommendations were focused on accelerating exit from the contracts, and gaining clarity on the strategy and relative system responsibilities after the LSP contracts expire. Action planning and activity is occurring, with an assurance of action plan expected summer 2014.","A gateway 3 was undertaken on the 8-10 January 2014.   The key outstanding actions relate to  the review of programme governance, the recommendation to draw up a contingency strategy including go/no go milestone and to produce a delivery roadmap for NHS e-RS.  In response to recommendations received the programme obtained Programme Board approval of  a Contingency Strategy and updated the programme plan to include a series of go/no go milestones linked to the NHS e-RS initial phase development plan.  The programme governance has also been reviewed and the governance structure revised.   Actions are in progress and on track for completion and are being tracked to closure with the NHS e-RS Programme Team providing the SRO with assurance of progress via monthly Programme Board Highlight Reports.","All actions from the MPA Gateway 2 review in June 13 have been addressed. The major points covered in these recommendations were on clarifying the procurement approach with Government Digital Services (GDS). The procurement is now underway using a dedicated managed email framework.

Other recommendations centred on project controls and resourcing which have now been addressed.

Clarification of the security level of the solution was also flagged, this has now been done and agreed with the Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG).

Lastly It was identified that there was a need to clarify the situation regarding supplying NHSmail accounts to Any Qualified Providers (AQPs). The Outline Business Case (OBC) outlines the approach for AQPS - increased inclusion - this has now been approved by HMT.","A Programme Assurance Review occurred in February 2014 (joint between CSC and BT LSP Programmes). Its recommendations were focused on accelerating exit from the contracts, and gaining clarity on the strategy and relative system responsibilities after the LSP contracts expire. Action planning and activity is occurring, with an assurance of action plan expected summer 2014.","PSNH was rated RED Delivery Confidence at MPA Gateway 2 Review. While progress has been made against the recommendations, Delivery Confidence remained RED due to the dependency upon the N3 programme to achieve extension.
N3 Delivery Confidence was RED as the extension business case has failed to gain approval. Any approval to spend from 1st April for N3 became contingent upon moving into the termination period provided for in the contract and agreeing a revised commercial position with BT.
In addition, a clear agreement on future strategic intent was needed before the approval for N3 could be granted.
To ensure PSNH can deliver successfully, continuity of service for the current N3 was  necessary, to enable the requisite time for procurement and implementation. Therefore, due to N3 having a Delivery Confidence of RED for the current service and the delivery of the revised business case, PSNH Delivery Confidence was also stated as RED.
N3 has subsequently moved into transition and funding has been approved. Agreement on the future strategic intent for health and care networking has also been agreed with the Cabinet Office as part of the approval; the PSNH programme is now working to achieve the commitments made by the end of June 2014.
Delivery Confidence rating remains RED as any future approvals for PSNH are contingent on ensuring the commitments within the strategic intent are evaluated and progressed by the end of June 2014.
","The Patient Information Pack process has been fully completed.

The implementation trajectory for record uploads and sites going live for viewings has been re-forecast due to the knock on effect from the change from Primary Care Trusts (PCT) to Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG). The project remains confident that these will be fully completed by the close of the project. As of 1 March 2014 (Q4) there have been 35.3 million SCR uploads and 567 viewing sites have gone live.","Following the last Gateway Review (Dec 2012), five of the six recommendations made have been closed.  The closed recommendations relate to clarifying responsibilities and accountabilities, enhancing the governance structure to reflect the portfolio nature of the Programme, on-going collaborative support to Trusts, Trust delivery of procurement plans, and defining the Programme Team role post-procurements. All relevant actions against each recommendation are now complete. The remaining recommendation relates to each Trust to create clear benefit baselines; each Trust provided a calculation and assumptions in the central Outline Business Case stage, and each Trust will  finalise their baseline in their collaborative Full Business Case (FBC). 

As agreed with the Major Projects Authority each of the 6 projects will write their own local FBC at the conclusion of their procurement activity (i.e. there will be 6 FBCs – one per collaborative) - each of these is due by end of FY14/15 and will be subject to usual formal assurance and approval .","Major deployments are completed. Upgrades and additional Clinical functionality continue to be deployed. A Programme Assurance  Review occurred in February 2014 (joint between CSC and BT LSP Programmes). Its recommendations were focussed on accelerating exit from the contracts, and gaining clarity on the strategy and relative system responsibilities after the LSP contracts expire. Action planning and activity is occurring, with an assurance of action plan expected summer 2014.","The most recent MPA delivery confidence assessment recognised the programme faced challenges in:
• completing the development work for data migration
• ensuring that the owners of all interfacing systems complete their testing
• successfully completing the rehearsals for the transition and cutover
• securing effective resourcing for the transition and for live operation
• agreeing the strategy for future development
• creating an approach to requirements definition, approvals and procurement that enables the realisation of the benefits of an open and agile environment

As a result of the assessment, the programme is taking action:
• Finalised the date for delivery of the development work for data migration
• Reviewing the approach to stakeholder communications to increase stakeholder confidence
• Streamlined PPM processes to ensure the highest quality in those that contribute most to managing for success
•Whilst it is anticipated that Core, IAM and SUS will be delivered in 2014, it is prudent to consider the contingency options with the Cabinet Office and the supplier
• Develop the requirements definition, governance, decision making and communications approach for the future development and exploitation of the new capability","Spine Extension is aligned with the overall programme strategy (including Spine 2 and SUS replacement). It meets an existing business need and to a large degree continues established Business as Usual (BAU) services, rather than a project delivering change. It provides the operational time to transition the services to a lower cost base, which will be delivered through Spine 2. It provides continuity from today’s environment and utilises well established:
• Management processes
• Business organisation and supplier capabilities
• Clearly defined responsibilities
• Resources, and
• IT security measures.","The Delivery Confidence of this report reflected the SRO view based on the failure to achieve approval for the N3 extension business case.

N3 Delivery Confidence was rated GREEN at the last Gateway 5 (Operations Review and Benefits Evaluation) MPA Review. However, since this point, approval to spend from 1st April became contingent upon moving into the termination period provided for in the contract and agreeing a revised commercial position with BT. 

In addition, a clear agreement on future strategic intent was needed before the approval could be granted. 

Therefore, the current N3 Programme and its deliverables were rated RED. Allied to this, the challenge of achieving approval of a revised business case by 1st April 2014, would have also attracted a RED Delivery Confidence rating.

Subsequently, progress has been made on moving N3 into transition and approval has been received to fund N3 for a further 12 months.

Agreement on the future strategic intent for health and care networking has also been agreed with the Cabinet Office.  

Delivery Confidence rating remains RED.
","There were no further outstanding actions following the October 2012 Gateway Review.

An Earned Autonomy Review (EAR) took place on 11/03/14 as a final review of the programme which has confirmed that NHSmail can exit future GMPP reporting.","Discussions have been undertaken with the SRO and the MPA and agreement was reached that following the 2013/14 GMPP Quarter 3 return that CAB Variation would combine future assurance with NHS e-Referrals Service.  

The most recent review of Choose and Book was a gateway 0/5 undertaken in May 2011 . All actions were completed and closed by May 2013.  ","The programme governance has been strengthened, through the establishment of a cross-government programme board, along with an L&D programme board chaired by the SRO (who is at Director General level in the DH) and the appointment of an externally recruited professional Programme Director. All of which has resulted in the tightening of governance which has had the effect of placing the programme in a position where successful delivery of national roll-out of the L&D programme is becoming more tangible. As the programme moves into its implementation phase, it has produced implementation plans for the remainder of the programme, and addressed data / ICT strategy; workforce issues; risk and issue management; programme resources.","The Project Assessment Review (PAR) in October 2013 gave a red/amber rating. An action plan was produced, agreed and ratified through the Childhood Flu Implementation Board and action taken to address concerns from the MPA. As the scope of the programme has now changed considerably from the original proposal, it was agreed that the Action Plan should be signed off and a full Gate 4 Delivery review would be held in Q2 2014.","The project is now over, officially live service commenced in July 1 2013, following six months of transition and transformation. The transition project ended in Oct 2013, following the decommissing and exiting of the legacy arrangements.",No departmental narrative. ,"Following the MPA Delivery Confidence Assessment rating of Amber/Red, a detailed Management Action Plan was developed in consultation with the key Programme stakeholders which identified specific actions to be taken to address the findings from the MPA Review. 
Due to the complexity and unique nature of the Programme, targeted actions were implemented leading to: 

1. Changes in the leadership and governance arrangements for the Programme to enhance the overall robustness by supporting the delivery and effective management of the current phase which largely involves procurement of the equipment, assurance and securing the necessary Government approvals. 
2. A revamp of the Programme environment providing clarity to where accountability and responsibilities lies at the various tiers of the National Programme, for example, 

o DH is providing leadership and responsible for:
i. Capital Funding
ii. Programme management and delivery
iii. Approvals and assurance using mandatory Cabinet Office and HM Treasury processes.  

o NHS England is providing leadership and responsible for:
i. Commissioning
ii. Clinical Services and Referrals
iii. Mobilisation of PBT Services
iv. Clinical Policy development
v. Benefits Management and Realisation
vi. Engagement with key stakeholders including the Devolved Nations and professional organisations
vii. Research and Development. 

3. Improvements in the resource levels including confirmation of the core Programme team and use of subject matter experts in specific areas such as the role of a national clinical lead for PBT, workforce strategy and development, and communications.
4. Structured and coordinated stakeholder engagement – in particular, the establishment of a National PBT Special Interest Group (SIG) with the active participation of the relevant Clinical Reference Groups (CRGs); Health Education England (HEE); professional organisations such as The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR), The Society and College of Radiographers (SCoR), Institute for Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM). In addition, the Programme also has access to the expertise of specialists in the related fields relevant to developing a national PBT service in England. 

Early work has commenced to develop a national plan for the clinical management of patients who have been clinically assessed to benefit from PBT treatment. Part of this work involves the review and expansion of the clinical indications list via the new NHS England processes through the development of clinical policies by engaging with the relevant CRGs as a longer term strategy for the viability of a National PBT service. 
The culmination of these actions has put the Programme on a much improved pedestal in terms of governance, resources, communications, stakeholder engagement and the plans towards the delivery of sustainable benefits. ","The project successfully implemented the benefit cap, with phased implementation starting from April 2013. National implementation was completed by the end of September 2013. The actions recommended to the project by the MPA were already part of the existing implementation plan and were necessarily delivered as part of successful implementation. 

The benefit cap has now been rolled out to all Local Authorities across the country

To January 2014 over 38,600 households had been capped, with almost 11,000 no longer capped (28%).  Of those households no longer capped around 40% have gone into work, as indicated by the number of open working tax credit claims.

","The delivery confidence rating published in May 2013 related to the confidence in delivery of Phase 1, which was the progressive take-on and processing of new cases on to the 2012 scheme. All MPA recommendations were accepted and addressed. Subsequently, the Major Projects Authority delivery confidence rating has improved.  ","The system completed a successful rollout in August 2012 and is now well established as a critical component of live operations, routinely processing and accounting for more than 13 million payments each week. Work is underway to address points raised by the MPA about the monitoring of benefits post-Programme closure, and how lessons learned during the Programme, including successes and good practice, were communicated across the Department. A follow up review is planned in the second half of 2014. ","The MPA review in November 2013 recommended ways in which the programme could be structured and driven harder, rather than about the design of the proposed solutions.

The Programme has consequently enhanced its programme management processes and controls to support future successful delivery. The programme has also introduced a new governance structure which was a recommendation in the MPA review. 

The programme has added two debt projects, which will result in an increase in the amount of savings realised for the Government; and the development of the proposed risk assessment capability (Integrated Risk and Intelligence Service) has been transferred from the Programme to the DWP Departmental Security Design and Delivery team.",The Project was handed over into live running in March 2012.  The reassessment of IB cases is continuing as part of established business-as-usual processes.   ,"All Major Project Authority Actions and Recommendations have been completed/closed.
Programme delivery continues to require attention on some key risk areas, especially in relation to Independent Assessor supplier performance. 
Programme structure and governance is being reviewed to ensure it remains effective going forward. 

","The Programme is taking forward all recommendations from the last MPA review. The Programme is on course to achieve delivery within timescales and budget. There are still a number of complex issues that need to be resolved in a short timescale, regarding the closure of Remploy factories, and the programme to help severely disabled people to find and maintain “mainstream” employment.","Clearance of actions from the October MPA review is progressing well:
o A DWP Digital/Agile Governance Framework has been developed to support digital projects.  Monthly meetings are taking place with CO and HMT colleagues to establish a flexible approach to approvals and ensure programme momentum is maintained.
o DWP has appointed a Digital Transformation Director General and Single-Tier Programme requirements have been fed into the requirement for increasing DWP digital skills and capability.  A Digital Academy has been established and a number of the Programme team members are currently undergoing the 8 week development programme.
o We continue to progress early work on the contingency legacy solution as approved by Major Projects Review Group, with clear plans and critical milestones set for making decisions on whether to proceed or pause with the solution.  We are working with legacy suppliers to establish costs for this alternative delivery solution. 
o A set of 9 Key Performance Indicators have been established to track Single-Tier activity and will be populated at appropriate times in the Programme development lifecycle once information becomes available.  
o We continue to work closely with HMRC, our key delivery partner, to ensure plans and governance align.","During 2013, the Programme was reset, culminating in the revised plans announced on 5 December 2013.  These plans included:
o The continued roll-out of Universal Credit to ten pathfinder sites, completed successfully on 7 April 2014 with the extension to Shotton;
o The extension of this live service to include claims from couples in summer 2014, and from families in autumn 2014, with a geographical expansion to other sites in the North West;
o The creation of a rigorous ‘test and learn’ strategy so that both qualitative and quantitative impacts of this live service shape further developments;
o In particular, shaping the work to develop an enhanced digital service, due to start in low volumes in autumn 2014, with progressive development and greater scale through 2015-16;
o With the goal of making Universal Credit available in each part of Great Britain during 2016; and with the majority of existing claims to legacy benefits then moving onto Universal Credit during 2016 and 2017.

Early claimant evaluation results have been positive, showing 90% of people making claims online. Almost two-thirds of claimants think that UC provides a better financial incentive to work.

Progress has also been made against National Audit Office and Public Accounts Committee recommendations, including the strengthening of governance and reporting mechanisms, improving financial management, engaging more strongly with delivery partners, and recasting the business case to reflect the new delivery plan.

","The performance of the programme has significantly improved since the first year.  Official statistics published in December 2013 showed that 208,000 jobseekers have escaped long-term unemployment and found lasting work (normally at least 6 months) through the Work Programme.

Since the launch, the Department has taken, and continues to take, clear and robust action to drive up the performance of the programme and ensure the expected benefits are realised. This has included: placing 12 contracts under Performance Improvement Notices in June 2013; shifting market share to better performing providers in August 2013; and most recently, in March 2014, issuing notice of termination to one contract. 

It is not possible at this time to judge the overall impact of the programme, however a formal impact assessment is planned to be conducted in early 2015. 
","The Project went live in April 2012, and all DWP elements were implemented to agreed timescales. Seven of the 8 MPA recommendations have been acted upon. For example, key indicators of success and management information requirements were agreed and are discussed monthly between officials from DWP, the Implementation Unit, HMT and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The recommendation to appoint a Joint Senior Responsible Officer for other Government Departments was rejected, but DWP has adopted a joined-up approach with colleagues across government, reflected in these monthly meetings.","The early implementation results are very encouraging. As at March 2014, over three million people had been automatically enrolled in to a workplace pension, with high levels of compliance observed amongst those employers who have staged so far, and opt-out rates amongst employees much lower than expected. As implementation progresses through the staging dates to medium and micro employers, the Programme’s challenges may change. To help manage this there is an extensive programme of research and stakeholder engagement, both to track observed behaviours and to gain first-hand knowledge of how the reforms are playing out on the ground. The Amber rating above provides a realistic balance between the success of the Programme to date, the challenges ahead and the risk management in place.    ","Since last quarter, no change in RAG status, pending Gate 3 review before Full Business Case submission to HMT. Amber rating due to managing the circumstances around this particular physical location.","Since last quarter, no change in RAG status, pending Gate 4 review before Full Business Case submission to HMT. Amber/Green rating due to need to improve benefits tracking.",Since last Quarter no change in RAG status pending Gate 4 Review by Cabinet Office (MPA) and FBC approved.,"Since last quarter, no change in RAG status, pending Gate 3 review before Full Business Case submission to HMT. Amber rating due work in a Grade 1 listed building with high asbestos risks.","The RAG rating for Echo is based on our most recent Gateway (Gate 4, April 2011). A/G rather than Green feels appropriate in any case at this point, with remaining UK campus sites currently due to be deployed by mid November.  The UK campus sites are challenging and the risks are being carefully managed. Until systems and processes are fully tested and signed off, we have adopted a cautionary approach.",The majority of the projects have now delivered but a final version of the programme’s full business case is planned for completion and approval by HMRC’s Investment Committee in October 2013.,There is uncertainty in delivery of benefits amongst a number of major strands. A recommended revised full business case is under production.,"Whilst there is progress in programme delivery there are challenges in meeting programme closure requirements, understanding Spending Review 2013 impacts, and ensuring that the Spending Review 2010 obligations continue to be met.",Benefit delivery is ahead of profile and the project is ready to move into business as usual subject to formal closedown procedures which are underway.,All staff recruitment and training has been completed and the first strand of the project completed in February 2013.,"Following the successful commencement of main migration in April 2013 migration delivery is ahead of expectations; however there remain a number of challenges in including migrating the remaining PAYE schemes onto RTI, and bringing on board some of the very largest schemes by 5 October 2013.  There remains a key focus on the work to successfully deliver all critical business change activity including the work to prepare for the implementation of the October 2013 and April 2014 IT releases",No major concerns around achievement of targets. The Amber-Green rating reflects that there are some potential small managed concerns on the deliverables within the programme.,The portfolio continues to break new ground in terms of the introduction of Agile delivery methods into an organisation with established Waterfall delivery processes.,"From October to November 2013 a programme of press advertising invited policyholders who had not been contacted by the Scheme and who thought they might be eligible, to contact the Scheme. This purpose of this campaign was to aid the tracing of those policyholders for whom the Scheme had no address data or where there had been no response to mail sent to them. It proved successful in that significant numbers of these policyholders contacted the Scheme and subsequently received  payment. Since then additional methods have been identified for tracing policyholders and these have proved successful in increasing the numbers the Scheme has been able to find and pay.  ","The Programme was rated Amber/Red due to uncertainty around Communications Data legislative proposals and potential issues with long term affordability.  The Programme has, however, re-focused effort under existing legislation and has re-scoped accordingly taking forward work with stakeholders in priority areas.","The department has taken action to improve delivery and reduce the asylum budget. These include 
- More efficient processes, increasing resources and targets; 
- Increased collaboration with providers and external stakeholders; 
- New and focused customer service targets; and 
- Action plans to take forward recommendations from the recent audits and reviews.?
",A revised plan to achieve transition to the new service provider was developed and successfully implemented so that service was transferred on 12 March 2014.  Ownership of the Programme has now also transferred from the Home Office to the Disclosure and Barring Service which has established strong governance arrangements to take forward work on service modernisation.,"The mobilisation phase of this project has been compressed due to delays in securing the necessary approvals.  Nevertheless, our operator states that they can still mobilise prior to 1 September 2014 and we are working closely with them to facilitate this.  At present, actions progressed suggest that this timescale will be achieved although contingency is tight.","The Immigration and Asylum Biometric System (IABS) system was successfully delivered on 27 February 2012, it is operational and has replaced IAFS as the former UKBA’s biometric system. The programme also delivered the required capability for biometrics capture for Games Family Members at the 2012 Games.

IABS project also delivered the Strategic Biometric Verification solution and Watch list Core functionality in April 2013. This capacity will Support Biometric Verification with higher availability and greater resilience.  It will also add additional dedicated software and hardware to provide resilience and improved response speed.

A final review  of the project concluded that IABS has been delivered successfully and is functioning to users’ full satisfaction. The business case has been achieved and the benefits are being realised.
","The programme has uploaded far more data than was initially expected by this stage.  The new capability is making a practical difference to the police in identifying serious criminals and is also being used by the National Crime Agency.  Remaining work is focused on ensuring that final ""snags"" are addressed by the supplier which led to the delivery confidence rating at quarter 2.  Intensive work has been undertaken as a result of the rating to ensure the programme completed its full functionality.   The most significant issue has now been resolved.  ","The National Crime Agency launched successfully as planned in October 2013.   For the first time, the NCA brings together a single strategic intelligence picture, equipping the whole law enforcement community to better identify, and respond to threats and vulnerabilities. In particular, the NCA is focusing on the relentless disruption of high priority and priority criminals and their groups and has developed strong two-way links with UK police forces, and other UK operational partners.  It has already launched successful operations to tackle child abuse in the Philippines leading to 17 arrests in the UK; the arrest of criminals wanted in the UK in Spain; and the tackling of a Romanian based gang involved in child trafficking in the UK.","The programme remains on track to ensure that the NGOV contract goes live on 1 April 2014. The UKVI International Operational Regions with the support of a central HQ project team are currently managing transition to the new contract with the 2 commercial partners.  Contingencies are in place for any locations that are identified as at risk of delivery for 1 April 2014 to ensure continuity of service.  UKVI regions and FCO colleagues are supporting the commercial partner in securing these.  As of March 2014, 16 of 196 commercial partner Visa Application Centres have opened.  Lessons learned from these early openings are being considered and either resolved or contingency action taken.  Any potential risk to delivery continues to be monitored and resolved as necessary.",N/A,The Amber rating reflected the fact that there is time pressure to complete the tasks necessary for successful go-live  and a risk that the programme may be impacted by events outside of its control.,AMS was successfully deployed in August 2013.  The business case remains sound and realisation of benefits will commence later this year.  ,"At the time of reporting, the project was proceeding to schedule and on budget.  It is though currently under review  in the light of the availability of capital in 2015-16 and alternative proposals to provide the capacity that is needed that may provide even  better value for money. ","The rating reflected the pace, scale and complexity involved in delivering this cross government Programme.  The actions we have taken to mitigate the RAG status are as follows;  the Programme strengthened the team, resolved contracting and funding issues with stakeholders, carried out external readiness reviews and gained OBC approval from the emergency services, lead departments, CO and Treasury, to allow the procurement phase to be launched 14 Apr 2014. ","The Review into the replacement of Border Force core systems (Warnings Index and Semaphore) reported its findings in December 2013 and recommended a parallel build approach, with lower cost, early delivery, adaptability and broader scope.  The decision to adopt this option has now been made. The existing systems will continue to run for the next two years while the new capability is developed and rolled out.   ",The delivery confidence rating reflects the delays in placing the contract for the next phase of the project. All options are being analysed prior to establishing a new baseline.,New Buy: The Department has continued to actively manage a delivery strategy with the contractor; after approval there was no negative impact on the schedule.  Julius:  The programme is on-track to its revised schedule. ,"Since September 2013 the rebaselining of the Programme, and a re-worked schedule, has been agreed between MOD and the Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA). The Secretary of State announced agreement of the new contract in the House of Commons on 6 November 2013 and confirmed it was based on a detailed analysis of costs. Following the announcement, the ACA have undertaken a comprehensive review and re-organisation of their management structure in order to improve governance and delivery performance. The new contractual arrangements will deliver improved commercial terms that provide stronger incentives for the shipbuilding industry to construct the ships to the agreed budget.",N/A,"The department is managing issues such as skills, capabilities and dependencies through the maturing governance process.",Exempt under Section 26 of the Freedom of Information Act (2000),"The key deliverable post this delivery confidence assessment has been the Main Gate 4 Business Case which resulted in financial approval to procure aircraft for the first F-35B Sqn in order to meet IOC. The team is confident that the Lightning Programme remains on track to deliver on time and within its approved envelope. The team continues to monitor progress towards the development of a global support solution by the US JSF Programme Office and to mitigate any impact to UK delivery. The present Amber assessment is an accurate reflection of the programme which is still in the System Development and Demonstration phase. The UK is fully engaged with the US JSF Program Office, including numerous embedded UK personnel.  As the only Level 1 JSF Partner, the UK is also involved in development test flying alongside the US Services.",The project is progressing in accordance with the Project Plan and within budget.,It is too early in the Life Cycle for the programme to articulate on this fully. The Programme is still being bounded. The programme has been subject to an initial MPA external review since Q2.,"The MCSP remains within the Performance, Cost and Time envelope defined in the MGBC approval. IOC will be achieved within the not to exceed approval date (September 2014) potentially with some acceptable capability limitations which will be overcome by FOC, which is forecast for June 2015. ",Exempt under Section 24 of the Freedom of Information Act (2000),A recent review made several recommendations that have been fully accepted and implemented.  These included stakeholder engagement to closely manage the final stages of the Test and Evaluation programme which resulting in improved delivery confidence.  The overall programme is on schedule to deliver the full capability on time and within the approved budget.,No comment,"The A400M programme continues to make steady progress with the first customer aircraft delivered (to France) in August 2013. The UK A400M Training Service (which was approved in July 2012) continues to make good progress and remains on track to deliver in accordance with its agreed schedule. Action to address In Service Support (ISS) affordability issues has been taken, and the ISS Main Gate Business Case has completed scrutiny and is awaiting Ministerial approval which was anticipated in April 2014. ","A review of the programme has been conducted and the recommendations will be discussed between the SRO , Director Submarines, Project Team Leader and Programme Director to ensure coherence of action across Successor and Astute.","Following the withdrawal of one of the GOCO bidders in November 2013, the Defence Secretary announced in December 2013 that the GOCO competition was no longer viable at this stage. Instead, DE&S transformed into a bespoke trading entity on 1 April 2014 as an intermediate stage and embarked on a programme of transformation building on the DE&S+ option, and a competition for Managed Service Providers has been launched. Legislation to provide a framework for a transition to a GOCO in future, if required, has passed all Parliamentary stages.","A recent review affirmed that successful delivery of T26 GCS appeared feasible but significant issues existed which required management attention.   The Review resulted in a number of recommendations which are in the process of being implemented at Programme and Project level.  The overall assessment was that the issues should be resolvable at this stage of the programme and if addressed promptly, should not present a cost/schedule overrun.","All 6 Ships are now In Service, justifying the Green RAG rating.  Action is now in hand to close out the programme through the Departmental graduation process.",The Wildcat Programme remains within the Cost and Performance envelope as defined in the MGBC approval and all Performance risks are being satisfactorily mitigated. ,Actions are based around addressing scheduling issues therefore see Departmental narrative on schedule below.,Funding of future upgrades to ensure that Typhoon delivers its required capability outputs is being progressed through the approvals process.  Additionally further future capability requirements are being considered to ensure that Typhoon remains credible.  Shared development opportunities with export partners are being considered.,The generation of the evidence to support the publication of the Release to Service (RTS) for AIRSEEKER has been labour intensive and time consuming. Additional resource requirements have been met through employing a suitably qualified and experienced group comprising a mixture of Manpower Substitution and externally contracted Technical Support.  DE&S is in the process of presenting the initial RTS recommendation which if accepted will allow flying to commence earlier than programmed thereby addressing the operational requirement. The impact of this advance of schedule on the overall programme of record is currently being considered. ,"The last 12 months has brought considerable success to the Astute Class submarine project with the delivery of the first two of these exceptionally capable submarines to the Royal Navy. However the project remains a very technically demanding endeavour. The schedule to deliver the remaining 5 boats to schedule is challenging and delivery confidence is assessed as Amber.  Whilst the MOD, shipbuilder and supply chain have all learned much from the construction of the first 2 boats, challenges remain, and a number of  performance improvement projects have been established to address the main technical, logistical and management risks and issues. These all involve close working between the MOD and its main suppliers and are providing increasing evidence of the manufacturing performance required to meet the approved targets for schedule, cost and performance. ",The Fleet Management performance of WFM is on track and its associated methodology has delivered the fleet mix that is being used to equip the new Army 2020 structure.  The programme will not deliver the benefits that it forecast in 2008 mainly due to the reduction in size of the Armed Forces and partly due to an over-optimistic estimate of maintenance benefits and a lack of evidence in some areas.  The benefits will be re-baselined in the first quarter of FY 14/15.,The programme will address the seven recommendations identified in a recent review and actions to address them are being developed in a priority order. ,"The CEPP programme integrates together highly complex, multi-platform, multi-environment capabilities that offer major increases in Military capability. 
Over the course of the last year the focus has been on maturing the governance structure and aligning programme priorities. The major achievement milestones in CEPP have included: finalising rebaselining the QEC programme agreed in October 2013 and announced in November, eventually leading to Contract signature with the ACA for revised Carrier costs; approval of investment on the Lightning II programme  to provide the aircraft, infrastructure and initial support needed to achieve IOC; closing a potential capability gap in Airborne Early Warning (AEW) provision by accelerating the CROWSNEST programme by some 18 mths; developing and maturing a headline operating model  against which future capability and cost decisions can be understood; and preparing for SDSR 2015 including the consideration of options for the second Carrier, potential changes to Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) buy numbers and the Fleet Solid Support (FSS) capability.","The Amber/Green rating reflects challenges surrounding benefits management and to a lesser extent programme governance and resourcing, all of which are being addressed.","A DCNS MPA PAR in February 2014 identified a number of recommendations to improve Delivery Confidence.

Preparation is underway to conduct independent assurance on the programme in Summer 2014 to assess programme deliverables.","Strategic Business Partner Implementation Programme (SBPIP): DIO announced the preferred bidder on the 10 March 2014 with contract award on the 21 April 2014. This represents significant progress in the delivery of benefits to defence and the tax payer.
Operating Model Rollout (OMR): Initial Operating Capability (IOC) of the Operating Model (OM) commenced in April 2013 when DIO moved to its new organisational design and adopted new end to end business processes. Implementation is continuing and the approach has been independently reviewed via a Gateway Review in March 2014.",Actions already in hand and making good progress when the latest review was conducted. Any residual actions have been assigned to Business As Usual owners on Programme closure.,"Much work has been undertaken to improve programme governance, risk/benefits management and the understanding of dependencies.  In parallel, firmer and more formal governance mechanisms have been re-enforced at Programme Board level.  Significant effort has gone into enhancing communications/stakeholder engagement.  This has resulted in a more coherent approach to the development and delivery of a comprehensive communications and stakeholder engagement plan, which, in part, will enable the cultural change required within Defence and wider society.  Reporting on the performance of the Army’s recruiting and training pipeline has been increased.  Early indications indicate that the current Army recruiting campaign is improving the number of volunteers for reserve service and that the handling and processing of applications is more effective.  Finally, a notable achievement has been the success in meeting the demanding timelines required to support the passage of the Defence Reform Bill.","Having released the Invitation to Negotiate (ITN) at the end of December 2013 the project team have been able to commence the formal engagement/negotiation with the commercial bidders. The process is progressing well. 

In parallel to the negotiation process further actions have been taken to ensure greater delivery confidence. These actions include; 

- the implementation of an improved integrated approvals and assurance process across MOD, HMT and Cabinet Office; 
- strengthening of the governance structure to include other government departments that will be key decision makers in the process (the establishment of a Sponsoring Group, a senior level governance group Chaired by the MOD with representation from HMT and Cabinet Office); 
- enhancement of the team developing the in-house proposal to ensure that the output produced reflects the best that can be achieved within the public sector framework.","NEM has completed two phases of consultation with Service Personnel (Phase 1 during summer 2013, and Phase 2 between November 2013 and January 2014), which has delivered high quality evidence to support policy making.

NEM Stage III (Policy Writing and Implementation) will commence shortly thereafter.","Significant progress has been made with a clearly defined programme of work streams which have been prioritised to align to business requirements at Contract Award & In-Service dates and beyond. Service Delivery and Commercial are heavily engaged in the work. External Assistance has been brought in to provide additional resource capability. At the last OGC Gateway 3 review, conducted in January 2014, the review team stated that the NGEC programme team had rightly recognised the importance of Business Readiness and the training work stream which had made significant progress since the previous review in November 2013 and was gearing up to deliver it, supported by some External Assistance. ",The main focus has been on identification and realisation of benefits and the achievement of  the delivery of the Foundation Contracts (FC).  These embed the commitment from industry to their benefit targets.  The Rolls-Royce FC was signed in February 2013 and the BAES FC was signed in July 2013.  The Babcock Marine FC will be delivered through a Terms of Business Agreement (TOBA) and Maritime Support Delivery Framework (MSDF) .  The recent introduction of a non-financial benefit realisation process through the re-issue of the Benefits Realisation Plan is also helping to increase confidence in the programme’s ability to deliver enduring benefits.,"In the last few months there has been significant progress in the Programme.  Army planning is advanced in the support of 30 Unit moves/re-rolling in FY 14/15, principally in the UK. 48 Assessment studies have been conducted and this work has supported a structured process to review and agree the Army requirement and identification of infrastructure options within each site to inform Initial Gate Business Cases.  Other work has included engagement with Local Authorities on the provision of services for Army personnel and planning work for future builds.  This has included a range of environmental, habitat and transport studies.       ","Army 2020 was the subject of a Major Projects Authority (MPA) Gateway Review in April 2013, and was due to be again in May 2014. Following the AMBER rating received in the 2013 review the Core Programme team drew up an action plan based on key recommendations. The majority of these have now been auctioned, for example an improved stakeholder engagement plan and the inclusion of a programme risk on the cultural and behavioural changes that will be required by both Regular and Reserve personnel to ensure the delivery of the integrated force. The current main effort within the Programme is to complete essential work to determine how programme benefits will be realised, thereby articulating how the Army will operate when the new structures are in place.","Significant progress has been made with Marshall, as captured during the last Major Projects Authority (MPA) review.  In order to accord with best practice a specific Programme Board has been established with the Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) as Chair.  Additionally, all major milestones have been met since the Q2 Government Major Projects Portfolio (GMPP) report.",The move of the two Signal Regiments from Germany to Stafford in Summer 2015 remains on track.

This reflects that the payment system was not known at the time of the assessment, since then the project has obtained specialist finance and legal support to develop, model and test payment mechanism.     ","The Green rating reflects that the programme is on track to deliver. To date, 139 courts have closed, the latest of which was Andover Magistrates' Court in December 2013.  ","The Programme has an Amber-Red rating. This reflects the delays to the competitive process for the new service model (as a result of irregularities being identified in the existing service), the requirement to review the schedules as a result of the subsequent audit, the need to terminate and re-compete the Lot 3 competition. It also recognised the volume of work to be done before any contract award and that business continuity could be at risk if any further and unexpected delays occurred. Since then, the schedules have all been reviewed, quality assured by a QC for added assurance and final versions issued to preferred bidders. All the other recommended actions have either been undertaken or are in progress. The risk register has been redrafted to reflect the activity. Contract award of the new service is now expected in early June 2014.

Mobilisation of the Delivery phase is now well underway and to plan.",The Green status reflects that the project has closed and is currently planning its post implementation review.,"The Amber/Red status reflects that the programme has undergone a restructure and a revised approach to delivering the programme objectives has been adopted. This revised approach involves merging existing systems to deliver a single platform for MoJ and then aligning MOJ's provision of Shared Services with the Government's Next Generation Shared Services Strategy, which may lead to MOJ joining one of the Cabinet Office appointed Independent Shared Services Centre providers (ISSCs).",All recommendations were accepted and welcomed by the SRO and appropriate actions taken on each one.,"The Programme has an Amber rating. This reflects delays in the delivery of proof of concept. The Supplier is developing a solution to address the technical issues encountered during proof of concept phase. Once this has been proven to our satisfaction, we shall be in a position to agree an implementation plan for roll out. Prisons and NOMS HQ are still able to use the existing equipment","The Programme has an Amber rating. It reflects that the project was experiencing uncertainty at the time due to the need to investigate Serco (the lead bidder on South Yorkshire) for issues with another contract.

A decision taken in July 2013 awarded the operating contract for HMP Northumberland to Sodexo. In November 2013, the SoS announced that the competition for South Yorkshire would stop and the prison remain in the public sector.",Delivered on schedule,This Programme has an Amber rating. This reflects the uncertainty over the approach to the Crown Court solution and the  outstanding decision on an interim solution. This has now been addressed and a revised business case is planned for submission to the March '14 Programme Board.,"The Amber/Red rating was based on the complexity of a number of the options considered in late 2013.

","ONS/MPA narrative at Q2 2013:

The Web Data Access Project is an enhancement to the ONS web site which will provide access by private individuals and firms to volume data from the Census and to other ONS data sets. Initial problems with the third party supplier and inexperience in the use of the Agile development method delayed the project by several months. However, the project is now progressing according to plan, with the scheduled end date now March 2014, deferred from August 2013. A combined Gate 0/5 with Census 2011 will be carried out in May 2014.","ONS/MPA narrative at Q2 2013:

90% deployment for dispensing contractors was achieved on 11 Nov 2013. The original milestone of 100% deployment for dispensing contractors was downgraded to 96% by end March 2014, taking into account the reality that every possible service recipient will not be taking up the functionality.

The Programme had been strengthened at SRO and Programme Director level which has led to a tightening in rigor of the overall programme.  This represents a noteworkthy achievement, and reflects the hard work from the SRO and the Programme Team in getting to this position, in a challenging and difficult environment, which is to great credit of all those involved.  Since the last GMPP return, HMT has approved the Outline Business Case and we are currently finalising arrangements for the transition of the programme to NHS England, which includes the development of a detailed delivery plan with identified work-stream plans.

The pace of the roll out has been scaled down over years 14/15, 15/16 
and 16/17 to take account of newly emerging information about capacity to deliver a robust and sustainable programme thus resulting in smaller cohorts of children being vaccinated in these years.  The delivery profile has changed to reflect the need to run pilots in Secondary Schools to test costing, workforce capacity and the achievability of service models.

The plans to stage CSA case closure activity now reflect the intent

­ to micro-manage the initial phases of case closure using our tried and tested pathfinder approach;
­ to start initial case closure activities on those legacy scheme clients not receiving maintenance, and to support these clients towards arrangements that best suit their current circumstances; and then
­ to sequence case closure activities to minimise disruption for clients receiving maintenance, particularly where hard fought maintenance is now flowing. 

Phase 2 will commence when the system is ready to support client charging and case closure. 
",Final Programme closure took place in August 2012 following a full and effective handover to DWP Finance teams responsible for managing the system in a “business as usual” environment.,"The new initiatives added to the Programme, and resulting scope change, along with dependencies with other programmes has resulted in a change to the delivery schedule, moving the end date of the Programme to 2016. New initiatives added to the Programme will deliver further fraud, error and debt savings for the taxpayer.","Around 90% of cases have been reassessed or are in the process of being reassessed.  For the majority of these, reassessment has been completed.  Most reassessments will be already completed as planned in 2014.","The Programme delivered as planned, a controlled start for new claims in April 2013, followed by a national roll out for new claims in June 2013. By the early Autumn it was apparent that the average length of an assessment was much longer than planned. The Independent Assessment Providers are consequently increasing their capacity so that overall claim processing times return to a satisfactory level. In the mean time, the start of the reassessment of existing DLA claims has been phased: commencing on 28 October 2013 (Wales, West Midlands, East Midlands and East Anglia) with further roll outs on 13 January 2014 (Southern Scotland) and 3 February 2014 (areas in the North of England). Further phased rollout of Natural Reassessment is dependent on the planned improvement in the performance of the Independent Assessors. ","The Programme is continuing to work closely with commercial and legal colleagues to manage the complexities of the sales and asset disposal processes. Remploy’s commercial process was on course to meet programme timescales and by end September 2013 the commercial process was reaching conclusion, with only the automotive business and its three sites to be completed.

","Delivery remains on track against plans announced on 5 December (see above).
At the same time, to support this cultural transformation, the Department has:
• rolled out the Claimant Commitment to all new JSA claims across the country;
• introduced Universal Jobmatch, an online job posting and matching service for jobseekers and companies;
• begun eleven in-work conditionality pilots to test how to best encourage claimants to progress in work
• expanded improved access to digital services across the Jobcentre Plus network.

The project team is continually assessing the project delivery plan with the aim to pursue the most ambitious timeline. ,There are two closures remaining before the programme closes in September 2014. ,"Since this report, there has been an audit of existing electronic monitoring services and subsequent referrals to the Serious Fraud Office. This has significantly delayed the progress to contract award, as the initial specification has been reviewed in light of the findings. Lot 3 (hardware) of the competition is being re-competed under an accelerated process.  We are aiming for contract signature for Lot 1 (Services and System Integration), Lot 2 (Monitoring and Mapping Software) and Lot 4 (Network Service) in June 14 - with Lot 3 to follow shortly afterwards. A test run of the new tags will take place in December 2014 with full service commencement to start in early in 2015. ",The Client & Cost Management System (CCMS) pilot has been live since November 2012 with a number of early adopters coming on board in September 2013. The expansion of the user base over a 14-week period is underway and will be completed at the end of June. The use of the system will be mandated from October 2014.,"The FITS Programme is nearing the end of its procurement phase and is moving into delivery in line with the approved plan.  The remaining contract procurements for End User Computing (EUC), Wireless Area Networks/Local Area Networks (WAN/LAN), Hosting Services and Application Management and Support (AMS) are progressing to schedule.  ",The changes were implemented on schedule on 1 April 2013. The project has been closed and a post implementation review will take place shortly.,The programme remains on course to deliver to the revised schedule.,Programme completed and closed successfully.,"Deployment is running approximately 6 weeks behind schedule and there are a number of technical issues affecting the stability of the new system at the Proof of Concept (POC) sites. Currently the delivery completion date can be held by commencing activities, such as printer deployment, early and a more aggressive schedule in the later deployment waves. ",The contract award for Northumberland was 6 weeks later than scheduled but the time was recovered during mobilisation with service commencement as planned on 1 December 2013. The project is now in closure.,Delivered on schedule,Programme on schedule.,Planning of the projects to enable the delivery of Reform  is underway .,"The Government response to public consultation was published on the 5th Sept. The delivery of the Crime Competition services has been delayed from August 2014 to December 2014 in light of there being further consultation which is due to close in November. 
Since September 2013, the Government Response to the Next Steps consultation was published on 27 February 2014, setting out the way forward on criminal legal aid. On 27 March 2014, the Justice Secretary announced his decision to defer the implementation of the advocacy fee reforms until summer 2015.","The deviation from Schedule is being dealt with in a formal Correction Plan from the Supplier which will result in a Commercial re-baseline within the existing financial envelope. To address the Suppliers complex parallel development issues, the Authority has prioritised the multiple parallel strands of the Suppliers Capability delivery plan to enable a phased approach to be now taken to simplify their Programme Management and focus delivery on benefits delivery for the NCA. The revised plan is being worked on at Supplier Risk until it can be demonstrated they have their development under control and the plan can be rebaselined. ","The project is still on schedule. Preferred bidder was announced on schedule May 2013, and transition activities began as planned.","Departmental narrative at Q2 2013:

The RAG status of the Programme is now Amber. This reflects the progress made by a number of projects to improve their own delivery confidence and the agreement of the change package transition content, process and dates.

Progress is being made in recruiting the appropriate resources for the Programme.

A further Assurance of Action Plan (AAP) review was conducted by the Major Projects Authority on 8July 2013.  This review demonstrated the significant progress made since the Gateway 0 Review.","Departmental narrative at Q2 2013: 

Delivery Confidence reflects the work required to investigate the mechanism for transferring data to Eurostat. Plan to fix by March 2014. 

","Departmental narrative at Q2 2013:

Status improved to Amber/Red after the Approval of Action Plan (AAP) review was held 1 August. The review was positive and recognised the work undertaken to address the recommendations of the Project Assessment Review held in March 2013. The AAP Review team confirmed the delivery status of the programme as Amber/Red. The Strategic Outline Case is awaiting formal approval from HM Treasury and Cabinet Office
","Departmental narrative at Q2 2013:

Delivery Confidence has improved from Amber to Amber/Green. This reflects an improving confidence in successful delivery and recognises the challenges that still remain.

",No departmental narrative ,No departmental narrative ,"HE Reform affects academic year 2012/13 onwards, with the system changes reaching full implementation by 2015/16. The assessment of the long-term resource cost of loans has increased since the original cost estimates were made, primarily because the £21,000 repayment threshold for 2016 will now be more generous than originally planned due to lower than typical earnings growth. The budget figures reflect the original costs of the reforms and the forecast/actuals the current assessment of the costs. The original decisions on the reforms were taken in Spending Review 2010 and the assessment of costs and benefits used to justify the reforms were set out in the June 2011 Impact Assessment ""Higher Education: Students at the Heart of the System"".  The current assessment of costs is consistent with estimates available during Spending Round 2013. Any increase in costs above Departmental budgets will be resolved as part of annual discussions with HM Treasury.","Forecast costs of £350m include estimated cost of the employee free shares scheme (£300m) and execution costs (£50m). The final cost of the employee free shares scheme was £330m, with the variance due to HMG achieving a higher IPO share price than was originally estimated in the GMPP return.   The final figure for IPO execution costs was £27.1m.

Additional funding outside of the GMPP baseline quoted above has also taken place. Significant additional funding has been provided to the Catapult centres to expand the size of the network.

Subsequent reviews of forecast costs taking into account delays to the overall programme timeline (as a result of delays to the approvals, and in Trusts being ready to launch their procurements), show that there will be no programme spend in FY2013/14 other than programme admin costs. Contracts will be signed in FY2014/15 and supplier payments, which form the majority of programme spend, will commence at that point. ","The reduced forecast reflects a significant cost reduction exercise across the government portfolio, which resulted in this specific contract contributing a £33m reduction in total contract value (given up for the FY09/10 Comprehensive Spending Review but realised over several years.

The Trusts will charge this to NHS England. NHS England has identified an allocation of budget from the Overseas Programme to cover this cost. Furthermore, budgeted capital spend has been re-phased in line with the final version of the Trust OBCs. Actual capital drawdowns have fallen below this due to slower than expected spend caused by different procurement routes for The Christie building procurement and some forecast error. The delay in spend doesn't reflect slippage in meeting programme milestones. As a result spend now shows as under budget in 2013/14.",The forecast shown above of £14.6m does not take into account payments made by the project to Local Authorities via grants of £12.1m to fund New Burdens. The total spend in 2013/14 is £26.7m. The increase in costs was mainly as a result of additional expenditure on local support to help people into work using the flexible support fund and extending the project team availability by 3 months,"The whole life budget costs reflect the re-baselined business case figures which take account of the three commencement staged pathfinder approach.   

The in year variance of £12m is a result of pressure on suppliers  to reduce their estimates and actual supplier costs proving in some cases to be lower than agreed estimates as well as revised timing of activity e.g. on Disaster Recovery which moved some costs into 2014/15.

",n/a – variance not more than 5%,The reason for the significant under-spend against the in year budget is largely attributable to the change in approach to the Integrated Risk and Intelligence Service Project.

• the budget was based on a planning assumption that Remploy Employment Services (ES) would exit government control during 2013/14.  Subsequent market testing indicated a value for money exit could not be achieved, due to the length of time remaining on the Work Choice contract provision.  It was therefore decided to de-scope the exit of Remploy ES from the Programme and consider the future of Remploy ES instead as part of the Disability and Health Employment Strategy;
• the original planning assumption was that the exit of the Remploy Automotive business would be financially neutral.  By the time of the forecast, the commercial process was well advanced so an estimate of business sale proceeds was included, based on the offers being considered at that point; and
• the forecast also reflected successful action to mitigate potential customer & supplier contract liabilities.

",The programme handed back £3.8m funding to HMT reducing the budget to £10.2m as this was not required.          ,"The budget provision made for Universal Credit reflects the original funding provided to the Programme in November 2010, as part of the Department’s Spending Review 2010 settlement. 

The reduction in forecast spend reflects the changes in the Programme delivery and migration plans in 2013-14 since the original budget was set. The forecast reflects estimates based on plans/information as at September 2013 - full year expenditure is now estimated to be c£155m.
