Geological Disposal Facility Programme (GDF),BEIS,Amber/Red,"The primary objective of the programme is to site and construct a permanent geological disposal facility (GDF) as the safe, secure and environmentally responsible solution to the long-term management of higher-activity radioactive waste in the UK, excluding Scotland.

We have successfully developed and implemented a new employer levy and funding system, designed and implemented a new digital online IT system which enables employers to manage their apprenticeship programmes and established a new Institute for Apprenticeships all of which completed in April 2017. We are supporting transition from apprenticeship frameworks to new employer designed standards, establishing ways to raise BAME participation rates by 20%, designing a policy to ensure inclusive apprenticeships to support social mobility and, with the support of the Institute, significantly uplifting the quality and quantity of apprenticeships.

Starts delivered since introduction of the Levy in May continue to be very low and show a reduction of 61% compared to the same time last year. The new levy has transformed the way that  Apprenticeships operate in addition to the transition from frameworks to standards. This is a lot of change for both employers and the market to get used to . Employer behaviour is hard to predict and it is very difficult to accurately forecast spend during a period of such uncertainty.

The high ends of the scheme and surface access cost ranges have been used. These costs will be revised as scheme planning progresses. HAL, for example, announced a potential reduction of up to £2.5bn in scheme costs in January 2018.

Where a surface transport scheme is not solely required to deliver airport capacity and has a wider range of beneficiaries, the Government, along with relevant stakeholders, will consider the need for a public funding contribution alongside an appropriate contribution from the airport on a case by case basis. The Government recognises that there may be some works which may not be required at the time the additional runway opens, but will be needed as the additional capacity becomes fully utilised. Heathrow Airport Ltd’s (HAL) operational costs are not included in the Whole Life Cost (WLC) here but are included in HAL’s plans which are under development.",2018

The report excludes the enhancement of the service through the NIB Digital Referrals project.","Following an Assurance of Action Plan (AAP) review in September 2017, the Delivery Confidence Assessment (DCA) of Amber-Red from the May 2017 Gate 0 review remained in place. Concerns were raised by the review team about the ability to deliver paper-switch off (PSO) by September 2018, despite the technical development of the programme being to schedule. It was recommended that the programme review the hard target of September 2018 in line with provider readiness and resource requirements for paper switch-off once this is understood. However, the review team felt the programme had an exemplar approach to benefits realisation.  An assessment of IPA review requirements for the next phase of delivery is underway, with an interim assessment of the Paper Switch Off (PSO) programme and a Gate 0 for the Digital Referrals Programme planned for Q1 2018.Actions being taken from Q2 2017 to address these concerns included :1. Contractual Leverage. Enhancements to NHS England standard contracts, Quality Premium and Commissioning for Quality and Innovation to leverage use of NHS e-RS . 2. Revised Implementation Strategy to support the goal of ‘paper switch off’ by October 2018. The development of an implementation model to support the ‘hard target’ of meeting the 2018 Standard Contract requirement has necessitated a rapid change in approach and mobilisation effort. The new NHS Digital implementation function and programme team is working closely with NHS England to develop, agree and roll out a joint implementation strategy, assessing the ramp up of resources required and the challenges what will be faced. This collaborative approach to implementation will be a major step-up in both focus and resource from both organisations.3. Non-use Research Project: to investigate non-use of the system and feed into a revised strategic roadmap. 4. System Enhancements: A clear view of the enhancements and functional changes required supporting our user needs and the rollout of the service has been developed and agreed through ERAB (Electronic Referral Advisory Board) and the NHS e-RS programme board.

Automatic Enrolment Programme,DWP,Amber/Green,"The Automatic Enrolment Programme was established to implement the Government’s workplace pension reforms. The overarching aim of the reforms is to get more people saving more for their retirement. The Programme went live in October 2012, delivering:   1) Automatic enrolment - a new duty on employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme; and to increase the incentive to remain saving in a pension scheme, there is a mandatory employer contribution.2) The National Employment Savings Trust – which has a public service obligation to accept any employer who wishes to use it to meet their employer duty. It provides a good quality pension to individuals on low to moderate earnings. 3) An employer compliance regime - run by the Pension Regulator to support these measures. The implementation approach is gradual, with employers being 'staged' by size, over the period October 2012 to February 2018, with original business case estimates forecasting an increase of savers between 6-9 million. Contributions to pension schemes are being gradually increased over time to provide a period of adjustment for employers and individuals, with full contributions being paid from April 2019. The original business case estimated that once contribution rates were fully phased in, pension savings as a result of AE would have increased by £8 billion per year.","Programme implementation has been, and continues to be, hugely successful so far with the original aim of 6-9 million employees automatically enrolled being achieved ahead of forecast. The Programme estimates in relation to the amount of increased savings have also increased significantly to £20 billion per year against an initial estimate of £8 billion per year.The Programme has in place a robust monitoring and evaluation strategy that draws information from all of the programme stakeholders and is reported routinely on a monthly basis. Our approach to monitoring is iterative and analytical colleagues continually look to enhance the options available. The outputs of this monitoring show that there continues to be high levels of compliance amongst the c.1million employers that have declared and opt-out rates amongst individuals remain consistently low at around 10%.The Programme is now focusing on supporting small and micro employers through the final months of roll-out, alongside preparing all employers, and their employees, for the forthcoming increases in pension contribution rates in April 2018 and April 2019. The Programme is also working to support employers that have been established since October 2017 and must automatically enrol new employees into a workplace pension from the outset. Whilst there remains a level of uncertainty around the ongoing behaviours of employers and employees, when balanced with the significant success of the Programme in achieving its objectives to date, the programme board rate the programme overall as Amber/Green.",01.05.07,30.11.19,"The Programme went live on time.

The PLP needs to ensure that, using appropriate management information, explicit decisions are made on the basis of trade-offs between the time available and the achievement of value for money.• PLP needs to de-risk the delivery of the procurement of the ETOM (Estates Target Operating Model). It should produce both a detailed procurement plan and TT (Telereal Trillium) exit strategy and develop a critical path.

Echo 2 Programme,FCO,Amber/Red,"Echo 2 Programme is a telecommunications infrastructure programme which will procure Connectivity plus Voice and Video services for the British Council, DFID, and FCO (hereafter referred to collectively as 'the partners'), spanning over 550 offices in over 170 countries.  The current contract for these services is held by Vodafone and is due to expire for DFID and FCO in March 2018, and March 2019 for the British Council. Expiration of existing contracts for each partner organisation makes the procurements obligatory - retendering allows partners to harness new technology and thereby yield higher performance networks at lower costs The internal IT strategies of each partner organisation require more consistent and higher performing networks to enable transformation. There is also a cross-department 1HMG insistence to reduce operating costs, have better control, transparency, and assurance with regards to ongoing value for money. There is also a need for flexibility to change services in line with changing business practises, which the current contract does not permit. Key benefits include reducing ICT costs via a combined partner purchase power approach, providing Official commodity services and flexibility by disaggregation of service contracts, adopting new technologies and contributing significantly to the  One HMG overseas  initiative (involving progress towards Co-location, regionalisation, consolidation, collaboration and harmonisation) as well as partner sustainability targets.     ","The original OBC for the ECHO2 Programme was approved on 17th January 2017 by HM Treasury following earlier departmental approvals. Since the OBC was approved there have been a number of changes in approach. Whilst these are not substantive, the programme undertook an Accounting Officer to be satisfied that the Echo2 programme is within the approved OBC scope, and continuing to meet the four accounting officer standards of regularity, propriety, value for money and feasibility. The Accounting Officer Assessment was approved in November 2017. This is a complex multi-faceted governance arrangement due to the cross-government joint-partnership aspect of the programme. Governance structures were reviewed by the IPA in June 2017 and a revised structure was signed off by the Programme Board and Steering Group in July 2017. Due to the joint-partnership nature of this programme, the stakeholder community is also quite complex - however, the environment is stable in particular since the revised governance was agreed in July 2017. Stakeholder engagement is generally good with a number of stakeholder groups including engagement at a senior executive level via the Steering Group. Whilst Echo2 will operate in a complex international delivery environment, the programme will conduct proofs of concept and roll-out on an incremental basis. This project is to replace the underlying Voice and Video and Connectivity infrastructure for DfID, FCO and British Council. This will enable each partner to harness new and improved technologies, underpinning technical transformation strategies. This is not a departmental policy initiative for any of the key partners and therefore the risk of political impact is low. The programme anticipates, from market engagement exercise, that there will be reductions in like for like service costs. Such reductions are likely to be offset by greatly increasing bandwidth requirements over the lifetime of the new contract. As we progress, the relevant FBCs will require HMT approval to test the VFM criteria. A lack of permanent civil servant resources was particular concern raised by the IPA in July 2017. Since then a civil servant (currently MPLA) has filled the Programme Director position and more interim resources have been recruited to fill the resource gaps. The programme has defined each of the roles and regularly assesses the viability for in-sourcing dependant on the longevity of the role both to deliver the programme and also into specific BAU roles to ensure continuity. Programme timelines remain challenging; two of the partners will have commenced their contract exit period before the new procurements have completed; whilst there is a 2.5 year contract run off period, experience from across Government suggests that Exit/Transition very often takes longer than originally envisaged. ",01.09.15,31.03.20,"Following an IPA assessment, it was deemed prudent to re-evaluate the programme plan and procurement approach. As a result of this, there is now a revised timeline and financial forecast. The timelines and finances are in the process of being formally re-baselined.The Programme is in the Project Delivery stage and both procurements have now commenced. The re-assessment of the OBC has completed and an Accounting Officer Assessment has taken place which has approved that the Echo2 Programme remains within its approved scope. The assessment also ensured that the programme is achieving Accounting Officer standards of regularity, propriety, value for money and feasibility. The analysis has largely verified what was proposed in the original OBC with some minor improvements.Both procurements (Voice & Video / Connectivity) are now in progress. The Voice & Video ITT was issued on the 18th December 2018 and the Connectivity Selection Questionnaire was published on 08th December 2018. The Connectivity ITT is on-track to be published on 23rd February 2018. The Voice & Video ITT will close on 23rd February 2018. Negotiations with Vodafone, to ensure satisfactory continuity of service, are reaching a conclusion. Previous concerns regarding the dependencies between the Vodafone negotiations and the re-procurements have been resolved.Programme timescales also remain challenging; the primary risks are;1. Two of the partners will have commenced their contract exit period before the new procurements have completed.2. Whilst there is a 2.5 year contract run off period, experience from across Government suggests that Exit/Transition very often takes longer than originally envisaged. Strategic Risks have also been signed-off by the Echo2 Steering Group and are being continuously managed Until such time as the procurements has progressed further and transition planning matured it is felt prudent to keep the RAG Rating as Amber. ",£2.33,£2.40,£171.40,Budget variance less than 5%,There is no change in forecasted whole-life costs.
