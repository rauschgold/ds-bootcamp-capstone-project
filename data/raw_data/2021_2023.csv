The Replacement Analytical Project has therefore been initiated to deliver future analytical capability to the Sellafield site, through a major modification of the National Nuclear Laboratory Central Laboratory.  Key modifications are provision of standalone Highly Active (HA), Medium Active (MA) and Special Nuclear Material (SNM) analytical capability.  A key part of the scope is the delivery of 135 Analytical Instruments which will perform the ongoing analysis required by facilities at Sellafield.  Analytical Services remains essential to the delivery of high hazard reduction and remediation until the completion of the Sellafield Ltd mission.","The Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating is Amber.This is primarily due to the following factors: The project is made up of a number of workstreams the last of which is due to complete the preliminary design phase in July 21.

Our intent for the Space Based PNT Programme is to improve the resilience of UK Critical National Infrastructure by having the right space-based capability to deliver PNT services in order to protect our way of life and to address the rapidly evolving global threat and hazards landscape.
We will consider the broadest set of options for space -based PNT whilst using the breadth of the Government's experience of major programmes to provide critical analysis of emerging candidate solutions.

It will almost double the road capacity across the River Thames east of London and is the largest single road investment project in the UK since the M25 was completed more than 30 years ago.

As a vital part of the UK's transport infrastructure, it will act as a catalyst for national and local economic growth.  Building a reliable, modern new road that is fit for the future will help connect the nation's busiest ports to the distribution hubs in the North, Midlands and beyond. It will improve network resilience and the performance of the existing crossings at Dartford, transforming the regional and national road network.

The Budgets also include In Service Support until 2025, which is primarily delivered through the contracted General Dynamics UK support solution. This element delivers a support framework and purchase of spares to support in service vehicles.

Although the Baseline Forecast Budget from Q2 19/20 ≈Å6288.953m to Q4 20/21 ≈Å6353.940m appears to increase by ≈Å64.987 this is because historic budgets are not adjusted as Programme costs and budgets are rolled forward into future years.

The scheduled baseline programme end date remains at 30 November 2026. However, the following are areas of risk for the baseline programme end date:

Supplier requests to extend the End User Services procurement window have pushed the dates outside of their current time approval. This was formally accepted since maintaining a viable competition was key to success for End User Services.

Similar delays have impacted Records Management and Managed Print procurement, these projects currently remain within their approvals envelope.
