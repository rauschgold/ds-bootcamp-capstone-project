Description / Aims,The 2015 Pensions Remedy Programme was created to end age discrimination within the Civil Service Pension Schemes and is also creating solutions to remediate any affected to historic members of the scheme.,"The original Commercial Capability Programme successfully established the Government Commercial Organisation (GCO) - a single central employer of several hundred Commercial Specialists (Grade 6 and above) for central government departments. The Civil Service Board endorsed proposals that commercial capability building interventions should be extended to Grade 7 commercial professionals within central government, Wider Government Bodies (WGBs) and training and accreditation developed and delivered to the Civil Service contract management community. The Commercial Capability Expansion Programme has been established to impact these new target populations deeper within the Civil Service and more broadly across the Public Sector.","Falcon is a business change programme that will fundamentally underpin the digital transformation of the Cabinet Office.The Transformation will be achieved through two key areas of investment. First we will update the OFFICIAL IT platforms within the Cabinet Office, which will contribute to reducing cyber-security risk, address legacy systems and automate underlying infrastructure. The second work stream the Cabinet Office we will invest in, will enable the implementation of the Central Digital Data Office (CDDO) interoperability policy standards and guidance through the migration of the department to Microsoft Office M365. This will enable better interoperability across government as we move both our people and data from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365. The Cabinet Office is at the heart of Government and a common productivity suite will enable more efficient and effective ways of working.","Future Services Programme is a series of procurement and transformation projects within the Pension directorate of GPG. Key projects within the programme include The Civil Service Pension Scheme (CSPS) and the Royal Mail Statutory Pension Scheme (RMSPS). Ministers have a legal requirement to deliver administration services for the CSPS. MyCSP Ltd currently administers the CSPS under a contract with the Cabinet Office that will expire on 31 December 2023, although transitional protection clauses in the contract means that the current service can continue until December 2025. RMSPS services expires in September 2023 however a year long extension has been although transitional protection clauses in the contract means that the current service can continue for 2 years.","GOV.UK One Login will provide a single account for people to log in, prove (and then reuse) their identity in order to access all central HMG services. 

The programme, delivered by GDS, will replace the current digital landscape of siloed and duplicative sign-in and identity-proofing methods, providing a front door for services that will continue to be delivered by government departments. In doing so GOV.UK One Login will provide a better user experience, more efficient use of government resources and strengthen the government's ability to counter fraud. The system has been designed with inclusion at its core, so that it will work for everyone. One Login will raise the degree of confidence of identity verifications against internationally recognised GPG 45 standards and improve our ability to spot patterns and more sophisticated types of fraud.","The Government Hubs and Whitehall Campus (WHC) programme is transformative, delivering the Governments priorities: 
- Providing a smaller, better and greener public estate 
- Strengthening the UKs economic recovery from Covid-19 
- Levelling up economic opportunity, maximising productivity and improving value 
- Supporting the governments ambition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 
- Strengthening the Union of the United Kingdom 
The programme supports the Places for Growth (PfG) initiative which encourages the movement and creation of jobs outside London and contributes to the levelling up agenda; as well as supporting pursuit of the Governments Industrial Strategy and the transformation of the Civil Service, .","NUAR will standardise, centralise and make available privately and publicly owned data from hundreds of organisations about the location of underground utilities assets.

A phased delivery programme includes a minimal viable product (MVP) for North East England, Wales and London, which launched in Spring 2023 (on schedule). The MVP is a major milestone - delivering core functionality and containing data from 80+ public and private sector organisations, including all major energy and water providers. The platform will be iteratively enhanced and rolled out to the remaining areas of England and to Northern Ireland. Good progress is being made onboarding asset owners outside the MVP regions.

Departmental commentary on actions planned or taken on the IPA RAG rating.,"Compared to financial year 21/22-Q4, the Delivery Confidence Assessment rating at 22/23-Q4 remained at Amber (SRO rating). This is primarily due to the following factors.
We are currently on track to implement the next 2 stages of the programme to deliver the functionality to rollback impacted members accounts to a pre-2015 position and offer retired members and immediate choice for benefit payments of the 7 year remedy period (1/4/2015-31/3/2022) and for future retirements a deferred choice. Amber status reflects some concerns around the suppliers resourcing levels. There is an agreed plan in place to mitigate this and we are working closely with the supplier to ensure effective delivery of the project.","Compared to financial year 21/22-Q4, the  Senior Responsible Owner's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating at 22/23-Q4 remained at Amber. This is primarily due to the following factors.
Following the IPA Assurance Review in March 2020 we received a programme Delivery Confidence Assessment (DCA) of Amber/Green. The Review Team found the programme had built significant success in building capability across the senior Commercial Function, including to G7s in Central Government Departments. We have followed up the review recommendations including a stakeholder stocktake review to improve delivery with the target contract management population and priority wider government bodies. However the impact of COVID-19 has significantly impacted delivery over the last 2 years and we downgraded our DCA to Amber.","The Senior Responsible Owner's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating at 22/23-Q4 is Amber. This is primarily due to the following factors.
The DCA of Amber reflects the position of the Falcon Programme in February 2023. The programme has continued to build capacity and capability to ensure it moves forward, it has successfully on-boarded partners and commenced the Discovery phase. Delivery is closely managed by the a Programme Board attended by our Partners to ensure a balance in pace of delivery and quality and ensuring Value for Money. The Programme supports further independent assurance reviews and this are planned alongside the production of a Full Business Case that will be submitted for approval by the Cabinet Office and by HM Treasury for funding to build the new platform and migrate users and their data to Microsoft M365.","Compared to financial year 21/22-Q4, the Delivery Confidence Assessment rating at 22/23-Q4 decreased from Green (IPA rating) to Amber (SRO rating).

The GOV.UK One Login programme continued to deliver at pace in 2022/23, successfully meeting its major planned milestones. These included the launch of One Login's web- and app-based identity checking routes, integrated with its authentication and account functionality, and the onboarding of its first [8] government services. By year-end, over 1 million users had successfully proved their identity through One Login. The programme deepened its collaboration with departments, agreeing roadmaps that will see the bulk of central government services move to One Login in the current Spending Review period, in line with the programme's business case. This progress also enabled the legacy GOV.UK Verify system to be retired, as planned. The overall AMBER rating reflects the challenging pace of delivery, especially as GOV.UK One Login scales up, and the complexity of both the technical solution and the migration of major government services, all of which the GDS team is actively de-risking.","The Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating at 22/23-Q4 is Amber. This is primarily due to the following factors.
Programme remains Amber, in line with IPA rating given in April 2022. In the period the Programme has delivered a new Hub in Peterborough alongside interim accommodation in Darlington, Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent. Since the last IPA Review the Programme has successfully addressed and closed all recommendations including undertaking PMO maturity assessment, mapping and augmenting processes from project initiation to completion stages and provided greater clarity around roles and responsibilities, empowering experts at the right time. Since the current Hubs Programme funding envelope was approved as part of SR21, there has been considerable change, which means that it is now necessary to amend programme plans. The programme is committed to providing an updated Business Case to CO Ministers and HMT which looks to amend scope to reflect construction inflation, cost of borrowing, IFRS16 regulations, smaller Civil Service, utilisation of hybrid working and availability of grade A office space on the market.","Compared to financial year 21/22-Q4, the  Senior Responsible Owner's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating at 22/23-Q4 remained at Amber.

Since the GHNF was launched in March last year, three funding rounds have been completed, with the fourth recently closing for applications. To date, we have publicly announced more than 117 million of GHNF awards to 9 projects which use a range of low-carbon technologies including heat pumps, recovered heat, deep geothermal and energy from waste. This includes an announcement on 12 May of nearly 91.5 million in grant funding to 7 projects in Yorkshire, Cornwall, Reading and London. We believe this is the biggest ever announcement of capital funding for heat network projects in this country in terms of the cumulative amount. The UK Infrastructure Bank also announced on 20 December last year that they will offer councils streamlined access to their 4 billion local authority lending product as part of the GHNF application process. In Powering Up Britain and the Energy Security Plan, published on 30 March, the Government announced that capital support will be extended to 2028 to facilitate the continued growth of low carbon heat networks, including 220m additional capital support over 2025/6 and 2026/7 for the Heat Network Transformation Programme, of which the GHNF is a part. Following this, on 30 May, we announced that additional funding will be available for the GHNF and that projects can now apply for funding that can be drawn down in the financial years through to 2026-27.

"Departmental narrative on  budget/forecast variance for 2021/22 
(if variance is more than 5%)",The budget variance exceeds 5%. This is primarily due to a significant underspend on behalf of our supplier and compounded in built contingency funds.,The budget variance exceeds 5%. We are continuing to deliver within our operational constraints and are now forecasting to have a 600k underspend for this financial year (FY2022/23's budget comprises the Accelerator Fund of 3.02m plus 680k for Capability-building for the NHS). This is because only 29k has been spent to date for Capability-building for the NHS due to lower than expected demand throughout the financial year.,"The programme was challenged to move at pace but was unable to complete the complex procurement activity in the financial year due to extensions in timelines, which were at the request of the market. One of the preferred commercial frameworks was closed (G-CLOUD12), forcing the programme to move to G-CLOUD13 and restart that procurement. These factors were the key drivers behind the budget variance which also impacted the programmes ability to onboard staff resource. Commercial contracts for the 2 supporting partners were signed in Q4 23/24.",Data already completed on GMPP,The programme's departmental-agree Whole Life Cost at 22/23-Q4 is 305m. One Login build and running costs have ramped up in 23/24 as the product is developed and services onboarded.,There are projects that are not progressing as initially expected due to a review of strategy between leasehold and freehold. The outcome of that review is still awaited but other non-impacted work is continuing. This has had a significant impact on what could be achieved in year.,"The baseline costs for this year's budget have been amended following the Central Finance Team's supplementals exercise in Cabinet Office. As part of the exercise, the programme exchanged some budgets with the next financial year.
The RDEL underspend is due to the Welsh Government grant not being used, less legal support services than originally forecasted and the lack of need to release the management reserve.
The overspend in CDEL is due to a late capitalisation of expenditure from last year and higher performance of the suppliers than originally forecasted.",The GMPP project did not provide data,"The project's departmental-agree Whole Life Cost at 22/23-Q4 is 35m. At present the programme's baseline wlc remains the same as when we entered the GMPP in the first quarter of 2022/23. As mentioned previously, due to the re-baseline it is likely this may change our wlc figure. We are currently undertaking a review of the cost impact and will reporton this in the next reporting round.",The budget variance exceeds 5%. The programme has exceeded the anticipated budget as it has been unable to meet the initial timescales for delivery.,"The budget variance exceeds 5%. The forecasted Whole Life Costs have reduced to 965m, compared to a 1,059m baseline. Last year's submission was based on the OBC, informed by Should Cost Modelling, and during the last 12 months the bids for the 4 main procurements covering the Performance Partner, Operational Security, Hard and Soft FM have been received and our forecast has been updated accordingly. This has generated an overall saving against the OBC as a result of a competitive market tender process.","The budget variance exceeds 5%. The ATF has surrendered some programme  budget in the past year and other forecasted  project spend has slipped right, for a number of reasons, into future years. The ATF team will assess the impact on benefit realisation and continue to closely monitor the benefits delivered by means of annual project reviews. The team will continue their engagement with industry and discussions across government to establish a long-term commitment to secure zero-emission vehicle manufacturing in the UK and improve the speed at which government provides support.","The budget variance (savings) is as a result of the programme exceeding expectations and delivering efficiencies across the department 1) the move to digital by default, 2) the renegotiation and reduction in spend of an under-performing overseas contract 3) a reduction in headcount within the EITA project",The GMPP project did not provide data,"The budget variance exceeds 5%. Due to delays in implementation caused by the legal cases, we are saving money on implementation in 22/23. Litigation costs have been added to the budget and forecast in 22/23 with the underspends in 22/23 added to the forecast in 23/24.
Whole life project costs are now 177.47m; this has increased due to the additional litigation budget of 22.6m required for our court cases which was a contingent liability in our business case. The profiling of this is between 22/23 and 23/24. A delay in the court cases to January 2024 has caused variances between budgets and forecasts, however we have approval to carry over unused litigation budget to 23/24, preventing an overspend.","The budget variance exceeds 5%. The in-year variance reflects the management of grant in aid drawdown from year to year. The in-year forecast spend represents anticipated expenditure on the Blythe House project, while the baseline represents what is being drawn down in grant in aid funding. There is an arrangement whereby the museums can draw down the grant in aid funding for non-Blythe House project expenditure, and 'repay' it to the project in future years.",The GMPP project did not provide data,"The Youth Investment Fund saw substantial demand for capital funding, however, a significant number of applications were at too early a stage of development to be considered for the programme.The created an underspend for this financial year, and in order to balance the funds spending profile with the emerging pipeline of capital works, that has been reprofiled into 24/25.

This is primarily due to the following factors: 
1) The baseline that was approved by Investment Committee in the SOBC was prior to business planning for 2022/23 and was subject to change. 
2) Delay in progressing work during 2021/22.","The budget variance exceeds 5%. There is a significant variance on this programme which is due to the pausing of many programme activities whilst the Target Operating Model was worked through. There has also been a significant reduction in the site operator monthly charges as well as an assumption the operating costs will be recovered from FY 24/25 - the previous assumption was that this would not be possible however that assumption has changed, and is confirmed as being legally possible. Capital costs for further site development are also better understood and are lower, as have been some of the capital costs invested in physical infrastructure and Digital Delivery in Financial Year 22/23.",The budget variance is inferior or equal to 5%. ,"The budget variance exceeds 5%.

There is a reduction in total in year spend this quarter against the baseline forecast because of the adaptation pathways approach meant there was less consultancy spend than previously forecasted. We also paused our Early Supplier Engaged Contractor due to the adaptation pathways which we did to seek efficiencies in our delivery approach.,The budget variance exceeds 5%. In year spend has exceeded the original baseline figures. This is due to having favourable weather conditions that allowed for ground investigations scheduled for next financial year to be brought forward to this financial year and having higher resourcing costs than when originally baselined.,Forecast spend for 22/23 is c. 2.2M (7%) below the budget allocated primarily as a result of the Programme not spending c.1.5M of optimism bias that was built into the allocated budget as SRO-owned contingency for the Programme.,The programme was unable to spend its full allocation of funding for 22/23 as it took time longer than expected to staff the programme and to procure the services required.  This was due in part due to  recruitment restrictions introduced in 2022 and difficulties in getting projects through the commercial process in time.  We have now recruited four commercial staff to focus on NCEA procurement and filled many of the vacant posts.,The UK Seafood Fund remains on track to spend the 100 million provided.

The forecast budget variance  is less than or equal to 5% though underspend arising from late project abandonment and scope changes tends to emerge very late in the year so risks remain that this will increase once full year data is available,"The in year baseline of 85.93m represents the planned scope to be delivered against the plan put in place in 2019. Actual scope being delivered this financial year is 16.07m, at a cost of 54.78m.  The project has delivered less scope than originally planned due to delays in completing design and progressing enabling works (COVID-19 / resourcing issues / supply chain contract delays). The actual scope that has been delivered has cost more than planned due to the requirement of additional design hours and increased management and overhead costs.","The variance between the 22/23 baseline and actual is due to several factors: 
The project has made a number of true savings against the FBC on the scope delivered to date, there has been positive management action taken to secure supply chain contracts for less than the budget. In addition, the project was able to deliver 19.5m of the working plan last financial year in order to de-risk the forward schedule.","The in year spend is less than the budget for 2022/23 due to realignment to PPP Multi Project Procurements and the Category Management approach.  This shows that the project is not spending money ahead of demand, does not affect the overall spend position for the project and better aligns key procurements to the current construction delivery strategy.

The annual total budget variance exceeds 5%. This is primarily due to the initial agreed CDEL baseline in this report for FY22 /23 being 236m, where the budget allocated was actually 80m.  The CDEL and RDEL budgets were underspent due to Wave 2 competition outcomes being known too late to enable maximum  delivery in the financial year 22/23.",Underspend in previous financial years was reallocated in last spending review.  Variance is against original business case spend profile.  Current forecast including this variance is within the overall envelop of the original business case.,The budget variance exceeds the 5% threshold against the business case due to the increase in costs to deliver Core Customer Engagement Management (CEM) subsequently creating in year Annual Performance and Resource Agreement (APRA) pressure resulting in other project timelines pushing to the right,Exempt under Section 43 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (Commercial Interests) - Commercial interests.,"The budget variance exceeds 5%. The budget variance is mainly due to reprofiling of the HTE Skills Injection Fund, and clawback from the HTE Growth Fund.",Key factors for variance are: the budget has an element of demand led costs through grants. Capital spending has been delayed until FY 24/25 and the budget for FY22/23 and 23/24 surrendered; Programme staffing pressures for FY22/23 and 23/24 released due to reorganisation and costs absorbed by central budgets.,"The budget variance is inferior or equal to 5%.

This is partially offset by underspend on RDEL which mainly relates to
- changes to Industry Placements Employer Support arrangements
- revised forecasts from IfATE due to structural changes
- refined delivery plans for Phase Two of T Level Professional Development (TLPD)","The budget variance exceeds 5%. The programme is recording a -42% variance primarily due to an end of year accrual not meeting tightened assurance requirements, which resulted in a c.52m underspend. The remaining level of underspend is due to reduced uptake of NPQ participants and reduced numbers of ECTs coming through the ITT pipeline.",The GMPP project did not provide data,Variance due to the adjustment for the NR VAT re-calculation.,The GMPP project did not provide data,"The baseline for 22/23 was set in the 21/22 FY, prior to appointment of the Delivery Integrated Partner at a point where the preliminary design was still being improved. As the project mobilised the Regional Delivery Partnership contract, we acquired more certainty over work packages through the year.  National Highways also changed the supplier for its project controls function (the contract) and the contractual rates differed from the assumptions made when the baseline was set.","There have been delays to the schemes delivery plan milestones due to a Judicial Review challenge. The impact of delays associated with the legal process has significantly impacted the projects programme and cost.

Yearly budget/forecast variance is due to higher actuals for 2022/23 than the baseline costs which were projected in 2020/2021. However, 60m of contingency was released therefore reducing the overall Anticipated Final Crossrail Direct Costs.  On Network Works saw a re-profile of costs into 2023/24 for residual works and commercial closeout.",The GMPP project did not provide data,Programme costs in 2022/23 were significantly higher than the baseline because delays to the power supply upgrades led to costs moving from earlier years; total costs have not changed.  The delays were principally due to the redesign work needed to satisfy a change in interface requirements from the electricity Distribution Network Operators and archaeological discoveries at a worksite near Berwick.,"The budget variance exceeds 5%. Updated planning assumptions have changed the forecast of spend, with some construction activity due to take place in later financial years than was assumed at FBC in December 2020. Whilst spend has been reforecast in this way the project continues to perform well against it's overall Anticipated Final Cost position",The budget variance exceeds 5%. Variance of anticipated spend is primarily due to a review of the schemes priority leading to slower progress than originally anticipated.,Variance is as a result of the costs associated with the delivery of the route section between Market Harborough and Wigston being included in the MML KO1a project rather than MML3.,The current forecast is within 5 per cent of budget.,The current forecast is within 5 per cent of budget.,The current forecast is within 5 per cent of budget.,"The budget variance is due to advancing the acquisition of Southern Valley Golf Course, Port of Tilbury Land and Pilgrims Lane lease.","The project remains within budget, with a small amount remaining for final close out activities.",The project is currently well within budget and there is no obvious reason why this will be exceeded.,The budget variance exceeds 5%. Majority of underspend sits with Network Rail due to funding and remit being confirmed in Q1 of Financial Year 2022/23 which impacted Network Rail ability to mobilise and commence activity at the start of the Financial Year (22/23).,The budget variance is inferior or equal to 5%.,"The challenging SR21 outcome for DfT rail set a difficult context for reform delivery, including increased risk of future service cuts and liklihood industrial action because of a tight cost-envelope for passenger services and ambitious workforce reforms. Removal of contingency across workforce reform in the SR due to savings/efficiencies commitments remains ambitious. RTP had a successful SR outcome with agreed funding for 80% of original bid, enabling us to progress the programme, although the settlement does reduce contingency and some discretionary elements of reforms so requires rescoping.  We expect further clarity once the financial re-baselining exercise for the programme has been agreed.",The GMPP project did not provide data,"The budget 612m budget set at SR21, since then the scope has matured significantly, and Northern Powerhouse Rail facilitation projects have been integrated.  At the same time, significant efficiencies have been generated which have outpaced inflationary pressures to reduce overall project totals.  The consequent resequencing and reforecasting of the project prior to its next major approval in 2023 has resulted in the variance shown.",The budget variance is inferior or equal to 5%. Variance caused by delays against delivery  of in flight programmes as well as organisational restructure impacting ability to launch new projects on time. However a re-profile has also been approved  and will allow us to retain most of our underspend.

This includes the costs associated with implementation such as dual running, releasing staff time for training and the time spent converting paper records to digital. This is reflected in our PBC and our economic model.","The programme has underspent in the 2022/23 financial year due to slippage in the programme schedule including approval of the OBC taking longer than planned, extension of the timeline for submission of Supplier Questionnaires in order to maximise the opportunity for supplier submissions and a commercial issue impacting on the issuing of the Invitation to Submit Initial Tenders. The impact to programme timelines have required significant reprofiling of budget assumptions. Work to reprofile costs for future years within the existing funding envelope has been undertaken. Forecasted figures for 23/24 have been updated accordingly.",The GMPP project did not provide data,"The budget variance exceeds 5%. The delay in the go live for the new market entrants occured as onboarding of new entrants proved more complex than originally anticipated, and directly led to an overspend on NME & Adapters as the transformation element of the funding was not budgeted for in FY 22/23, but continued into that FY.",The budget variance exceeds 5%. The budget for delivery of the project was exceeded due to an increase in resource following critical recommendation from an IPA review.,"Early planning GMPP project 

(The project has not yet passed SOC, or its programme equivalent)",The budget variance exceeds 5%. The data for the budget and forecast shown are based on figures provided in the June 2020 PBC which will be superseded.  Successive changes to budgets have amended the schedule with consequential impact on forecasts.,"The budget variance exceeds 5%. The programmes in year budget variance is due to a higher spend than forecasted on the Building Safety Fund. This relates to a positive change, with a higher number of buildings achieving the financial milestones related to funding approval to completion, resulting in greater spend. The financial model has been re-designed to deliver a more robust and consistent 12 month forecast. In response to the increase in buildings and improved forecasting, the approved programme expenditure will increase appropriately, with HM Treasury approval sought through the single remediation full business case in financial year 23/24.","The Affordable Homes Programme has delivered c. 4,400 fewer starts on site than originally forecast this year, leading to less capital spend than planned.  This is primary due to changes in the wider economy and environment for social housing landlords impacting providers ability to fund new development. The programme is currently in the process of re-negotiating contracts with providers in order to address the additional costs, as a result of changes to the economy.  It is expected that some of the lost delivery is re-forecast and planned in future years, but some may fall away completely.  The re-negotiation of contracts is due to complete in late Spring.",Delays to awarding technical support contracts delayed spending in FY22/23 by several months (-2.3m). Part of this underspend (+0.3m) was utilised by providing additional support to Local Planning Authorities for digital citizen engagement projects.,The budget variance exceeds 5%. Programme headcount and staff costs in 2022/23 were lower than planned for in the programmes budget.,The initial profiles submitted at spending review were based on estimates. These are being revised once all Freeport Full Business Cases are approved. 7 of the 8 English Freeports have now received final government approvals. The final Full Business Case is due to be approved in later in 2023 once the customs site designation is complete.The revised business cases meant some spending profiles have been moved further back into the next financial year.,"The budget variance is inferior or equal to 5%. The programmes budget/forecast variance is mainly due to an underspend on Resource Departmental expenditure limit (RDEL).  

- RDEL: The programme has continued to replace contractors and consultants with civil servants, which, alongside the introduction of controls on recruitment, have primarily contributed towards the RDEL underspend.  

- Capital DEL: Following the completion of safety works on time and to budget, CDEL costs have become static to reflect the ongoing maintenance required on site, resulting in a very minor overspend against the revised budget.","The budget variance exceeds 5%. The funding drawn in year is lower than forecasted primarily due to the macro-economic factors described which have raised costs across the larger Forward Funding portfolio. In addition to this, contractor appetite, resourcing, and Local Authority capacity have contributed to delay in funding being drawn and spend being deferred into future years.","Our in-year total spends for 22/23 were below the baseline budget outlined in the LUF programme business case reflecting the challenging economic environment particularly the impact of cost inflation.  We are supporting places by offering flexibility through a project adjustment request process to make sensible adjustments to the scope and phasing of projects to mitigate delivery challenges whilst also maintaining value for money.  We have also agreed a 65million package of support for local authorities, to help ensure they have the necessary capacity and capability to deliver their projects.","The variance to budget exceeds 5% due to the economic challenges for small and medium sized developers arising over the course of the financial year. These included inflationary and supply chain pressures arising following the reopening of the global economy post pandemic, later compounded by rising interest rates, tightening liquidity conditions and weaker consumer demand.  This led to a decline in the appetite for developers and investors to acquire and/or develop new sites, with a consequent impact on the demand for development finance and investment.","The budget variance exceeds 5%. Our in-year total spends for 22/23 was below the original baseline budget as set through Departmental business planning. This is primarily due to the Town Deal summary documents that were not submitted as forecast, causing programme expenditure to slip into future years. Inflationary pressures and an uncertain economic climate have also contributed to financial slippage for Town Deals and Future High Streets Fund (FHSF) places, as they seek to reprioritise projects through the Project Adjustment Request mechanism.","The budget variance exceeds 5%.

Project spend has stopped this is now a BAU activity.,We have surrendered some of our funding back to HM Treasury due to projects not starting work as soon as had been anticipated in the original Spending Review bid. We expect our spend to be within 1% of our new 63.1m Diversification budget at year end.,"The budget variance exceeds 5%. The budget allocated for Project Gigabit (Capital) in 2022/23 totalled 164.3m, with a post supps budget of 48.5m. The 2022/23 outturn is currently forecasted to be 42.4m.
The main reason driving the underspend, since the Supplementary Estimate position, relates to Vouchers, where the average value of a voucher was lower than expected with lower than expected claims, and Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy (GIS) procurements and subsequent mobilisation taking longer than expected.",The budget variance exceeds 5%. Not applicable,"The bulk of the R-DEL variance relates to staff-related costs and reflects lower than expected staff costs across both payroll and contractors due to recruitment delays and a tight supply position in the specialist contractor market. Additional underspends are due to delayed engagement of the Digital Delivery partner, revisions to Insight and Communications activity plans and lower than expected training and recruitment costs. The C-DEL underspend is due to delayed BETA activity and lower than expected IT hardware investment.",2022-23 Costs are lower than baseline as a result of challenges in bringing in resource coupled with changes in the plans and timetable for introducing operational initiatives meaning that the Programme did not incur the associated set up and recurring costs.,N/A as variance is below 5%,"In Financial year 22/23 Synergy expenditure (15m), was below the 20m drawdown. This is largely due to timing of expenditure on staffing and consultancy in departments. In March 2023, HMT agreed flexibility to allow the carry forward of the anticipated underspend in 23/24 (It is proposed to share an initial view of this with HMT) to support the Full Business Case approval into Q1 of financial year 24/25, through a date only extension.
The Programme is strengthening its financial management, linking closely with department teams to develop a resourced integrated plan. This will underpin managing expenditure in 2023/24.",N/A as variance is below 5%,"The baseline uses the Programme Business case (PBC) set in March 22 which aligned to the site level strategy at that point.  This baseline is therefore over one year old.  Since then, the site level strategy has been subject to change following feasibility stages and deep dives.  The outturn for 22/23 was 168.5m below the original PBC baseline, this was due to a number of factors, including the impacts of IFRS16 accounting treatment, lower than anticipated number of people exits, absorption of training costs within existing allocations, building costs per square metre being lower than original estimates and pausing of activity on sites not demonstrating value for money.
Additionally, to ensure successful delivery of benefits enabled by site closures, some improvement work has been reprofiled into the remaining years of the SR.
Despite the lower outturn the realisation of benefits remains on track with no impact to successful delivery of the programme.
To improve the cost management of the programme in future years we have undertaken additional scrutiny of the delivery plans and assumptions, as well as strengthening financial reporting processes.",The budget variance exceeds 5%. The ECHO 2 baseline forecast for FY22/23 (RDEL & CDEL combined) was 45.57m and the actuals for the year ended at 33.69m.  The variance is a result of the eight month delivery delay to the programme and subsequent delay of transition and dual running costs.,The GMPP project did not provide data,The budget variance exceeds 5%. Underspend on implementation costs in 22-23 reflects deferment of additional modules for Learning and Talent planned for implementation in 2023.,Original budget revised post-Covid,"The budget variance exceeds 5%. This year's forecast spend has been lower than predicted due to delayed spend with external digitisation suppliers, including delays in contract award, onboarding and exiting the implementation stage.  Consequently, there has been an underspend due to the movement in forecast for Transition Payments and New Burdens payments to LAs.","The budget variance exceeds 5%. 2022/23 full year final position at end of Q4 is 32% lower than baseline. This is primarily due to the baseline position included 9.6m for Moves Assistance Payments (MAP, formerly Daily Travel Allowance) which the programme no longer funds, and revised delivery timelines in several projects, and a move to Hybrid working which greatly reduces the cost to HMRC.",The budget variance is inferior or equal to 5%.,The budget variance is inferior or equal to 5%.,"The variance is mainly due to some planned activity not being required as some systems no longer needed any remediation, or were removed from the scope of the programme, supplier costs being overestimated, and the revision of the programme plan to move some work into the next financial year.",The budget variance exceeds 5%. The reason for the variance is because the programme closed down early and no work was carried out on SDRP.,The budget variance exceeds 5%. The baseline included a contingency in case the costs were higher than estimated. The contingency was not ultimately required as information technology costs especially those that are time and materials have come in less than forecast.,The reduction is due to the fact that the funds available to the programme were restricted during the year. This has been managed by re-profiling the spend and delivery plans into future years whilst still remaining within the overall programme timeline and spend allocation,"The costs of delivery in 2022/23 were lower than the original baseline mainly driven by elements that were paused due to the negotiations around the NI Protocol, the removal of some scope from programme baseline and the deferral of some elements of system re-platforming.",The budget variance is inferior or equal to 5%.,The budget variance is inferior or equal to 5%.,The budget variance is inferior or equal to 5%.,"The baseline costs were developed before lower-level cost estimates or supplier impacts were available and as such, the forecast had a high level of uncertainty. In addition, the assumption was that a major piece of work would be progressed much earlier than proved possible. This issue was identified early in the year and the programme mitigated some of the potential underspend by bringing forward some future work, but this has resulted in a circa 8m in-year underspend.",The budget variance is inferior or equal to 5%.,The budget variance exceeds 5%. The key reason why there has been an in-year decrease is due to the programme being required to deliver within the constraints of the reduced funding available. There has also been a reduction in programme scope that meant funding was re-utilised elsewhere in the business and HMRC are re-assessing the strategic direction.,"Forecast expectations going into the year included a provision for risk in the event of underestimation of our expenditure which has been managed out of our estimate, resulting in confidence and assurance in the cost base. Spend was lower in the early part of the year due to mobilisation times for IT delivery resource and external contractor expertise taking longer than initially projected. The Programme is now fully mobilised creating a steady state of run rate resulting in a predictable level of forecast.",The budget variance is inferior or equal to 5%.,"The small programme underspend for the 2022/23 financial year is primarily due to the complexities of onboarding a technical delivery partner to a programme of this size and scale and the need for readiness and mobilisation activities to move into the next financial year. Onboarding is now planned for mid-May 23.
Other reasons for the underspend include financial credits received from suppliers following the consolidation of completed work orders and the actual costs of work coming in less than forecasted.",The budget variance is inferior or equal to 5%.,The budget variance exceeds 5%. The cost of delivering TSS in 22/23 was lower than our baseline due to driving efficiencies within the running of TSS.,The variance is largely due to the reduction in contingent labour costs and build costs,"Programme costs were significantly lower than originally forecast in 22/23.  The Outline Business Case was not approved until November 2023, which was much later than anticipated and meant that the delivery phases of the programme were pushed back.  The Technology Delivery Partner was therefore appointed in Q4, later than originally planned, the programme team was not ramped up until Q4 and the next version of the business case pushed into 23/24 which meant that the original plans to spend 3.3m on a Technology Delivery Partner in 22/23 did not materialise.",The Programme's ability to spend in line with our allocations and earlier forecasting has been impacted by factors including delays in onboarding the required programme resource impacting delivery to the original schedule particular PPB meaning associated costs  will be incurred in future years instead of FY 2022/2023,The budget variance is inferior or equal to 5%. Not required as variance is less than 5%,"The budget variance exceeds 5%. DSAB has spent 71.8million against a budget of 61.7million, an overspend of 10.1million. DSAB began 22/23 with a budget of 57million and annual run rate of 95million+, a financial challenge of over 38million, or +66% of the programmes entire budget. Initial sentiment for overcoming this issue was positive, since early planning indicated an end or at least significant ramping-down of delivery activity in November 2022. However, technical milestones quickly moved out to beyond the end of the financial year, leaving DSAB facing the certainty of an adverse financial variance that would need to be mitigated as quickly and as fiercely as possible. DSAB finance has spent the entirety of the past financial year striving to close the gap between actual spend and allocated budget. Overall, despite numerous increases in monthly costs across multiple workstreams and immense pressure from continual high-value recharges from DDaT N&I and ES, DSAB has ended the financial year within 1% of the programmes Period 11, Period 6, and average full-year forecast accuracy targets.","The budget variance exceeds 5%. The overall forecast underspend is mostly driven by a change in Programme delivery plans and the exit of a key supplier. Some activities identified that could be paused/delayed during the substantial shift in the commercial arrangements and re-procurement, along with coverage build re-plans. These underspends and deferred activities are moving costs and timelines to the right. The impact will be reflected in the next iteration of the Business case.",Not required as variance is less than 5%,"The budget variance exceeds 5%. Optimism bias and contingency totalling 71m that was removed as part of spending review allocation. This results in the programme showing a larger under spend vs baseline than actual budget. In-year budgets were reduced by 10m in line with Optimus savings in Q1 and further savings have been identified with Digital Data and Technology Capital Departmental Expenditure Limit project lines, programme resource and Comms Media & Marketing through in year re forecasts. FBIS continues to take a proactive approach to managing underspends and addressing optimism bias in workforce plans. At P06 it was agreed that forecasts would reduce by a further 31m to return funds centrally early and ensure programme budgetary governance remains robust. The programme continues to deliver against key milestones despite taking on additional scope.","The budget variance exceeds 5%.

This has been done without losing sight of its overall programme aims and objectives. Therefore baseline has been updated in this quarter to reflect the latest approved Business Case. The overall impact of this has resulted in a reduction of 230.13 (m) in total spend from 7,084.84 (m) to 6854.71 (m), reflecting lower transition costs in moving to the new TSP procured contracts. There has as also been an increase in incremental monetised benefits of 29.49 (m) from 62.99 (m) to 92.48 (m).","Compared to financial year 21/22-Q4, the project's departmental-agree Whole Life Cost at 22/23-Q4 increased from 379m. to 532m.

The forecasts for the remaining three main procurement packages are based on initial bidder submissions with adjusted timings to reflect the current plan. The current plan assumes the existing provider, Atos, will provide termination assistance services during 2024-25. The greater certainty associated with the updated assumptions has enabled us to revise the optimism bias calculation. We also gained clarity on the VAT position following independent advice and made updates. In addition to these changes, we have updated inflation assumptions in line with latest ONS estimates.","Compared to financial year 21/22-Q4, the project's departmental-agree Whole Life Cost at 22/23-Q4 increased from 172m. to 198m.

The project did not provide departmental-agree monetised benefits at 22/23-Q4. 2015 Remedy has no benefits associated with it as it is a rectification programme to remove unlawful discrimination","The project did not provide departmental-agree monetised benefits at 22/23-Q4.
The project did not provide departmental-agreed monetised benefits at 22/23-Q4. This is an enabling programme and captures qualitative and quantitative benefit realisation data for reporting with programme stakeholders. Whilst we have clear evidence that improved commercial and contract management capability drives commercial benefits and prevents value leakage, the benefits accrue in participating organisations and there are a number of factors at play.","The project's departmental-agree monetised benefits at 22/23-Q4 is 60m.
 The programme will deliver cashable and non- cashable benefits delivering improved collaboration and efficiency in line with the CDDO interoperability policy from the migration of the Department from Google to MS365. The OFFICAL platform refresh will deliver enhanced cybersecurity benefits including mitigating the potential costs of addressing a serious cyber security attack.","The project's departmental-agree monetised benefits at 22/23-Q4 is 11m.
Benefits have been defined as part of the OBC and FBC which will be deleivered during transition. The final business case has been worked on and submitted to COAB for the July board part of which work will be done to revisit benefits identified within the early cost modelling stage to establish whether they are still relevant.","The project's departmental-agree monetised benefits at 22/23-Q4 is 1752m.
The programme's departmental-agreed monetised benefits, at 22/23-Q4, is 1751.6m for the 5 year projection. The cashable savings in the business case include reducing identity verification and authentication costs; reducing total cost of online user support whilst reducing total user support; and, reducing public sector fraud. We are in the process of developing KPI targets, and developing a dashboard for benefits realisation. In doing so, we are working closely with HMT and the Evaluation Task Force in the development of this monitoring plan. We are also working with departments as they onboard to update our baseline assumptions, through the administration of a data collection instrument.","The project's departmental-agree monetised benefits at 22/23-Q4 is 2630m.
 The current benefts are calcuated based on cost savings the programme produces over it's lifecycle. Capital Projects are working with GPA Finance to develop a new benefits calculator, and with a cross-GPA Working Group we are exploring how best to measure and report on Social Value. The Social Value Portal company have been contracted to support definition of new social value KPIs","The project's departmental-agree monetised benefits at 22/23-Q4 is 3474m.
 An external firm has been appointed to produce an evaluation and monitoring report, as per the FBC commitment to HMT, which will define the benefits measurement methodology and apply it to establish the baseline against which the benefits will be calculated.

The project did not provide departmental-agree monetised benefits at 22/23-Q4. We do not anticipate any monetised Benefits until April 2024.  We anticipate the following benefits - an increased robustness of vetting, productivity improvements and economic benefits from reducing street to seat times and reducing attrition. Increasing the technological capabilities will reduce the time spent by vetting officers accessing disparate data sources. In creating additional capacity through increased efficiency, we will create a continuous improvement fund which will be used to build a deeper quality of capability across vetting.","The project's departmental-agree monetised benefits at 22/23-Q4 is -30.69m.
 Overall the WSTP preferred option was expected to increase costs by 30.7m. However, this results from the investment in GPA staffing which is common to all of the considered options to adequately manage the growing estate and supply chain; and the introduction of the Performance Partner as the critical factor in driving enhanced customer and client benefit. The FM supply chain itself is expected to deliver 22m savings against the existing TFM model. The Baseline used is the OBC preferred option. The latest forecast is a benefit of 65.24m. The current award status is that two of the procurements have completed (PP and Operational Security) at an increased cost to the OBC, but the two FM procurements due to be awarded in Q1, deliver a greater  value saving compared to OBC.","The project did not provide departmental-agree monetised benefits at 22/23-Q4.

The work required to identify and monitor the benefits of the programme is underway, including data collection that will underpin our metrics. The next steps are to refine how we measure our current system (baseline) and what we need to do for future evaluation. Our evaluation will be informed by the departments published Analytical Framework which underpins the 2021 Export Strategy (Made in the UK, Sold to the World). As outlined in the Analytical Framework, we intend to use a number of different approaches including the maintenance and development of a range of internal performance metrics, the Export Client Survey, our value for money model, which considers the cost efficiency of our offer and the overall potential return and monitoring business satisfaction. Our approach also includes bespoke research where necessary.

We now have a first version of the benefits realisation plan which will be revised as work on benefits progresses. At this stage, we have the foundations of benefits management: we have identified the benefits, we have elements of how we will monitor and evaluate them, and have a credible theory of change. The next stages are to build benefit profiles, understand how inputs significantly contribute to the delivery of those benefits, and agree the longer term monitoring of benefits with the BAU structures. Work continues on presenting benefits calculations in line with the requirements of this return. Please note that the PBC outlined 1.062bn of discounted benefits for full transformation but this has been revised down to 918m following the OBR March 2023 Economic Outlook. Work continues to be progressed on the quantification of the benefits and this will be completed by Frontier Economics.

As set out in the Final Business Case, the programmes benefits realisation approach comprises of 3 broad activities: programme-level evaluation, monitoring and evaluation of individual workstreams during implementation and monitoring and evaluation of the Commissions approach to regulating during the 4th Licence. During the implementation phase, the benefits reporting will focus on development of individual workstreams (as set out in the business case). The overall benefits of the programme (Increased returns to good causes) will be delivered by Allwyn and dependent on the implementation phase delivering.
