The student experience at present is very poor, due to operational and technology issues including lack of availability of complete case information and the time delay between the issue of evidence by students to the completion of the application process at times of high demand.  Due to the limited technology update over the last few years the current system needs replacement.  A robust and agile customer-centred student finance system is required.   Introduce a modern, integrated and flexible IT system to enable the safe delivery of HE reform (including changes to borrowersÂ repayment terms including variable interest rates).
Â Enhance customer service and operational efficiency.
Â Support the transformation of SLCÂs business through introduction of a unified technology platform and the standardisation of processes.

Expected benefits:

Â Improved customer experience: easier access to real time information, additional communication channels and a reduction in incomplete calls, etc;

Â Operational efficiencies:  increased process automation, reducing avoidable contact and standardisation of workflows; 

Â Strategic fit: alignment of the programme with Government ICT strategy as well as with the strategic direction taken by SLC.

Â Financial benefits to Government: ensuring HE reform-related savings, agreed as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review, are realised; potential for increasing the value of the loan book and an increase in the recovery of student debts;

Strategic goals: Create and operate a Crown Oversight Function (COF), to provide governance structure to monitor performance of all Shared Service Centres (SSCs) and Dept retained functions; Work effectively with DfT and DWP to create two Independent Shared Service Centre solutions (ISSCs), which will operate independently from any customer organisation, and work with targeted Depts. to transition current services to one of these two solutions; provide oversight, sharing of best practice and benchmarking facilities to those Depts. where it has been agreed they can remain stand alone (MoD, HMRC and MoJ). Ensure a lower cost ERP solution is available as part of the ISSC solutions, reduce dependency and cost on the current dominant ERP providers,  remove barriers to entry for smaller Depts. and organisations by reducing software and maintenance costs.
The Programme and strategic goals will be delivered by four component projects: 
1. ISSC 1 is based on the DfT SSC in Swansea and has been divested to arvato. This is now in the process of being novated to Cabinet Office. ISSC1 will include a Low Cost ERP platform for smaller Depts. NOTE - DfT divestment (basis for ISSC1) is subject of a separate GMPP report
2. ISSC2 will build out of DWP SSC, working in partnership with DEFRA, EA and BIS and is currently going through a commercial procurement to deliver a JV partnership Â this is due to complete in October 2013.
3. Crown Oversight Function is monitoring performance of all SSCs and Dept retained functions. Performance monitoring is being undertaken through centrally agreed benchmarks at both organisational level and process level for HR, finance and payroll. The COF will also include reporting benefits for the NGSS programme; 
4. Single Operating ERP Platform Project (SOP). A key objective of the NGSS Programme is to consolidate ERP solutions and deliver standard processes across central govt depts. Central govt has a large portfolio of Oracle ERP implementations which require some form of upgrade to Release 12 and Govt has an opportunity to consolidate a number of solutions on to one Oracle Platform.

Â a more cohesive society by mixing participants of different backgrounds;
Â a more responsible society by supporting young peopleÂs transition into adulthood; and
Â a more engaged society by enabling young people to work together to create social action projects in their local communities.

NCS brings young people together from different backgrounds (e.g. religious, ethnic and socioeconomic) to work together, and teaches them what it means to be responsible and serve their communities. It is a high quality personal development programme that gives young people a chance to prove to themselves and their peers what they can do. 

NCS builds on a substantial range of government initiatives that aim to increase voluntary activity among young people and develop their life and citizenship skills. Such initiatives include the National Young VolunteersÂ Service , the Millennium Volunteers programme, and Volunteering Together. 

NCS is also part of a broader agenda of improving services and outcomes for young people between the ages of 13-19, reflected in the Positive for Youth policy statement published in December 2011 as well as drawing inspiration from international programmes such as the Americacorps, a programme developed in the United States that supports volunteering and engagement in social action .","NCS  continues to be fully on track to achieve all of its outcomes following the novation of provider contracts to the NCS Trust in November.

At the time  when the project moved to BAU there were three areas of concern (1) the programme was not funded (2) the programme was under-resourced (3) there was not an agreed benefits realisation methodology. All of these were addressed . During the transition to BAU steps were being put in place to meet the original objectives of the project and realise the benefits. G-Cloud came off GMPP with MPA and HMT approval once it was understood what actions were taking place. The G-Cloud programme has been successful in achieving its aims to support the Cloud First strategy and increase sales to SMEs.  Sales at the end of April 2014 have reached Ĺ175m, with 60% by volume and value being with SMEs. The run rate for the last few months is averaging at Ĺ16m a month, suggesting an annual sales figure of nearly Ĺ200m.  There is a programme in place to increase the monthly sales figure further. 

There is a full-time team of 25 x FTEs to support both the existing GCloud programme and the new Digital Marketplace that will replace Cloudstore later this year.  A budget of Ĺ3.9m has been allocated for FY 2014/15 to support all GCloud activities including support to suppliers and buyers.  The Alpha of the new Digital Marketplace will be live shortly after Easter and the Beta by the summer recess.  An efficiency and benefit review was carried out at the end of January.  This demonstrated that GCloud sales show a saving of 50% when compared to how such services were procured previously.  A savings methodology has been agreed with NAO for capturing and reporting savings into the wider ERG savings reports. 

As part of the programme, we are making it clearer, simpler and faster for the whole of the public sector to buy digital products and services when it needs to.  We are helping create a pool of quality suppliers of all sizes, who work in agile ways, to supply and work with government.  We are doing this by:

Smart Meters will give consumers up-to-date information about how much gas and/or electricity they have used in pounds and pence, as well as units of energy.  Smart meters will have benefits for consumers, suppliers and energy networks. Consumers will have near real-time information about their energy use, enabling them to monitor and manage their energy consumption, save money and reduce carbon emissions.  Switching between suppliers will also be made simpler. Energy suppliers will have access to accurate data for billing and will be able to offer a wider range of services and tariffs.  Energy networks will have better information to manage and plan current activities and support the move towards the development of a smart grid.

To deliver this commitment, DECC will enter into discussions with relevant developers with a view to considering what form of comfort might be given to support the taking of such investment decisions.  The FID Enabling project gives effect to this commitment.

By providing an appropriate form of comfort in advance of the implementation of EMR reforms, we are likely to encourage final investment decisions to come forward that would otherwise have been delayed until all necessary legislation had been enacted and new institutional arrangements put in place; or possibly cancelled altogether.  This supports the GovernmentÂs decarbonisation and security of supply objectives as well as stimulating investment which creates jobs and growth.  

The first developer to seek assurance through the FID Enabling project, and whom we have accepted meet the criteria, is New Nuclear Build Generation (NNBG), a subsidiary created by EDF Energy to build a new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point C. NNBG will not move to a final decision to proceed with construction in the absence of additional certainty on expected revenue in the reformed market. A delay until the enduring regime is in place could substantially increase costs (ultimately principally borne by the consumer) or result in EDF abandoning the project. Either of these outcomes risks setting back the rollout of new nuclear generation as a whole, because the other developers are waiting for EDF to bear the first-mover risks.

The FID Enabling project gives effect to this commitment.

The aim of FID Enabling for Renewables is to avert an investment hiatus in the deployment of renewable electricity generation caused by the announced reform of the electricity market, in the period between the publication of the EMR White Paper and the full implementation of the EMR CfD, expected in Autumn 2014.   In particular it seeks to enable developers to take final investment decisions, or other critical investment decisions directly impacting on the time to commission the project, which would otherwise be delayed by the uncertainty caused by the transition to the enduring CfD regime.

The project aims are as for the EMR CfD: to ensure that the UK can attract the investment in renewable electricity generation needed to meet its renewable and carbon emission reduction targets in the most cost-effective way as well as to have a secure, affordable, supply of electricity towards the end of this decade and in the longer-term.

Supporting investment decisions through the project will contribute to two of DECCÂs priorities:

Four specific objectives have been agreed
Â to prioritise schools (primary/secondary/sixth form) for rebuilding;
Â to build more for less;
Â to improve the future private finance model drawing on learning and experience from recent Building Schools for the Future (BSF) PFI deals, the HM Treasury review of operational PFI contracts, and Public Accounts Committee recommendations in response to the National Audit Office report; and
Â to use a centralised procurement model for the  programme in order to drive efficiencies in procurement time and ensure that a quality solution is obtained at the lowest cost.","The first Priority School Building Programme project opened in April 2014, on programme.

Projects were prioritised not according to the maintenance needs of schools buildings but according to the levels of deprivation and educational attainment in each area. It was originally announced that the programme would be complete by 2015; however this was later extended to 2023. The original estimated cost of the programme was Ĺ45 billion but this had risen to Ĺ52-55 billion shortly before the cancellation of the programme. Although originally planned as a 15Â20 year programme, it was announced by the Secretary of State for Education on 5 July 2010 that only projects that had achieved OBC approval by 1 January 2010 would continue.   

Since the decision was taken to allow only those projects beyond OBC by 1 January 2010 to continue, an exercise was undertaken in late 2010 to identify savings from the remaining programme. C.Ĺ250m was duly identified as efficiencies.

With it, we will transform intercity travel, radically improve commuter services into London and our other major cities and increase the amount of rail freight. 

These transport improvements will help support economic growth and make a major contribution towards rebalancing the economy.
The new railway will be built in two phases. It will be fully integrated with the rest of the railway network. It will bring benefits to places with stations on the new railway including Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and London; to stations on the classic network like Liverpool, Darlington and Newcastle which will receive high speed services; and to other places on the existing mainlines like Milton Keynes, Rugby and Peterborough which will have better services from released capacity on the existing main lines


  

","HS2 is in excellent shape and has made significant progress since September. The rationale for HS2 was published in the Strategic Case in October; the hybrid Bill was deposited ahead of the published commitment in November;  the High Speed Paving Bill received Royal Assent on 21 November and most recently the Phase1 Bill achieved resounding success at Second Reading with a majority of 452 to 41.  On April 9, 2014 an improved package of compensation measures for property owners along the phase one of the route was announced and on March 21, 2014 the HS2 Growth Task Force published findings and recommendations to the Secretary of State setting out the main challenges the Growth Task Force can see in maximising the benefits from HS2.  In addition, Sir David Higgins is now in place as Chairman and Simon Kirby has been appointed as the new Chief Executive for HS2 Ltd.   
On Communications Strategy:
We appointed a senior level strategic communications advisor to deliver:
Â A short-term communications effort that focused on the Second Reading of the Hybrid Bill;
Â A longer-term campaign plan based on detailed market research (to be developed); and
Â We now have an integrated communications team in place to deliver against this plan.
On Resourcing:
We have made key appointments to senior roles at HS2 Ltd including:
Â Sir David Higgins as Chairman;
Â Simon Kirby as construction CEO; and
Â Patrick OÂConnell as interim Programme and Strategy Director
Â Other senior appointments are in train and will be announced soon, including;
o Programme and Strategy Director
o Head of Programme Controls
o Communications Director 


Both DfT and Network Rail have grown their project teams, bringing in the skills required for the next phase of work. 


On timetable:
A timetable has been developed for the passage of the hybrid Bill through Parliament based on our assessment of the number of expected petitions.  We deposited the Bill on time, achieved success at Second Reading and we are now working with Parliamentary authorities to ensure smooth passage of the Bill through parliament.
Contingency plans, based on different scenarios for the progress of the Bill through Parliament, have been developed. 

On transitioning to the next phase:
On 19 November 2013 SoS confirmed that HS2 Ltd will be the delivery agent for Phase 1. Following this decision we have made significant headway in putting in place the people and structures needed to enable construction to start in 2017. 
An integrated Programme Management Office is being created under the responsibility of the new HS2 Ltd Programme & Strategy Director. This will cover all aspects of the programme including DfT, HS2 Ltd and Network Rail. 
An initial draft of the Outline Procurement Strategy (OPS) for Phase 1 has been developed. Our strategy for supply chain management includes ongoing engagement with industry. The first HS2 Supply Chain Conference in Birmingham in November 2013 set out our OPS to the supply chain.
A programme of work is underway to get ready for construction. A Baseline Programme is in place (Baseline 3) and the HS2 Phase 1 Programme Execution Plan (PEP) has been initiated to define scope and identify key inputs to the document. A critical path for Rolling Stock procurement has been developed to ensure alignment with the programme.

The latter project orchestrated the procurement and contract award (in February 2013), for the divestment of the former DfT Shared Services and the future provision of back office shared services functions to the Department for Transport (including its Executive Agencies). 
Following a procurement process, three preferred bidders were chosen in late 2011 and Competitive Dialogue started in February 2012. Dialogue concluded and final tenders were received, evaluated and a preferred bidder announced in December 2012. The Full Business Case was approved by the DfT Board Investment & Commercial Committee (BICC), Ministers and HM Treasury. On 28 February, the contract was awarded to arvato (part of the Bertelsmann Group). DfT completed the divestment exercise on 1st of June 2013

Stage 1 replaces a mix of unconnected buildings including wards contained in the Victorian Jubilee Building and a temporary modular building from 1970 that houses the Trust's Nuclear Medicine department. Stage 1 will mainly be wards and allows whole site to be better connected. Stage 2 replaces the Barry Building built in 1828 with a modern Cancer Centre and Reserch facilities. Stage 3 is mainly demolition costs to allow a Facilities Management compound to be developed and take traffic pressure off the local community. Capital Costs are Ĺ420m and are based on PUBSEC prices from 2011/12 when the Outline Business Case was approved by NHS South of England. Within the Ĺ420m are costs to decant Stage 1 site, Equipment costs where it's not possible to transfer existing and Ĺ61m of VAT that the Trust cannot reclaim. Whole life costs also include Revenue aspects of the project where Transitional Support is required from the Surrey and Sussex Area Team of NHS England. These costs include double running costs and a local Project Team who are designing the buildings and the services delivered within them.

69,Rotavirus Immunisation Programme,DoH,Green,"Background:  Rotavirus infection is the commonest cause of gastroenteritis in children under five years of age worldwide.   Rotavirus infection in the UK is seasonal, occurring mostly in winter and early spring.  In England and Wales an estimated 130,000 episodes of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis occur each year in children less than five years and approximately 12,700 of these children are hospitalised.  In 2011, following consideration of a peer-reviewed modelling study, JCVI advised that the licensed rotavirus vaccines would have a significant impact on reducing gastroenteritis in young children, and that the Department should introduce a rotavirus immunisation programme if the vaccines could be procured at a cost effective price.  Following negotiations with the manufacturer, the price paid for rotavirus vaccine resulted in the vaccination programme being cost effective.  The Department of Health has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution, to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective.
Objective:   The overarching objective of the rotavirus immunisation programme is the reduction of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis in England.   
Scope:  The scope of the project is limited to England and includes all the elements required to successfully deliver a rotavirus vaccination programme.  
Benefits:  The programme will deliver: (1) rotavirus immunisation for babies added to the national immunisation schedule; (2) a reduction of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis; and (3) a reduction on the burden on the NHS by reducing hospital admissions and visits to GPs caused by rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis.
 Rotavirus immunisation has been introduced as part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule from 1 July 2013 and is being delivered via GPs alongside the other vaccines for infants.

Since that time the supplier has been working closely with DH on their business critical requirements. This has resulted in a review of prices by the supplier which has cast doubt over the financial viability of moving to ISSC1 for a number of the bodies involved. The current position is that DH is working closely with the supplier and Cabinet Office to understand the drivers for the increased costs and the potential to mitigate them. At present unless prices fall the maximum benefit for Government as a whole will be derived by DH alone migrating to ISSC1 and the other organisations looking for alternative solutions.

71,Shingles Immunisation Programme,DoH,Amber/Green,"Background:  Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the chicken pox virus in a person with a dormant chicken pox infection.  It is not known what causes the virus to reactivate but this is usually associated with those with a suppressed or less effective immune systems.   Shingles incidence is highest in older people as the incidence of shingles increases with age; in the UK it is estimated to be around 790 to 880 cases per 100,000 people, an estimated 30,000 cases of shingles per year for people aged 70 Â 79 each year.  In 2010, JCVI advised that a universal shingles programme should be implemented for people aged 70 years and up to 79 years inclusive if a licensed vaccine was available at a cost effective price.  The Department of Health (DH) has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution, to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective.  Shingles vaccination will be introduced as part of the arrangements for delivering routine immunisations to adults. NHS England will be responsible for commissioning these services and will need to decide on the most appropriate arrangements for securing delivery as per the service specifications supplied by Public Health England (PHE).
Objective:  The overarching objective of a shingles vaccination programme is the reduction of shingles and associated sequaelae in England.
Scope:  The scope of the project is limited to England and includes all the elements required to successfully deliver a shingles vaccination and catch up programme.
Benefits:  The programme will deliver: (1) sustained improvements in public health; (2) a reduction in burden on the NHS by reducing the need for treatment and (3) a cost effective health intervention.
Maturity:  The Shingles vaccination will be introduced as part of the arrangements for delivering routine immunisations to adults.  The indicative start date for the programme is 1 September 2013, with the vaccine being given alongside the seasonal flu vaccine for the routine 70 year old cohort.   There will also be an annual catch-up programme offered to specified co-horts, commencing with 79 year olds in year 1 of the programme, 78 year olds in year 2, 77 year olds in year 3 etc. This pattern will continue until those eligible for the vaccine between 70 Â 79 are offered the vaccine. This delivery model is based around current vaccine supply.  The catch-up programme could potentially be implemented quicker if vaccine production increases from 2016","Project delivered on time and within budget with NHS/Providers being experienced in the delivery of new immunisation programmes.  There was a temporary delay with the supply of the shingles vaccine,                                                                                                                  ZostavaxĹ˝, into the UK.

73,Health Visitor Programme,DoH,Amber/Red,"In its 2010 Coalition Agreement, the Government committed to increasing the number of health visitors by an extra 4,200 FTE by April 2015.  Ministers want that extra capacity to bring with it the ability for local teams to improve public health outcomes for the under-fives, with health visitors having the time to provide parents with critical health and development advice, and to connect families to the array of health and wider community resources that help them to give their children the best start in life.  

As part of the GovernmentÂs Health Visitor Programme, a commitment was made to improve the quality of services offered to parents and families in the early years of a childÂs life.  It has been shown that high quality early intervention, prevention and support is vital to giving children the best start in life. The expansion of the health visiting service is intended to:
Â improve health and wellbeing outcomes for under-fives
Â reduce health inequalities
Â improve access to services
Â improve the experience of children and families.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 
The programme has faced a major governance challenge in 2013/14 with the creation of the new health and social care system. Responsibilities for delivery of the programmeÂs aims are now split across three key organisations: DH; NHS England; and Health Education England. This has meant recasting the governance and PPM arrangements to reflect Mandate responsibilities and the complex relationships. As the programme has moved into its key expansion and delivery phase, more focus has also been placed on preparing for successful handover of commissioning (as part of 0-5 childrenÂs public health) to Local Authorities later in 2015. A multi-agency task and finish group has been established to plan and deliver the transfer.","The following mitigating actions are in place to ensure all is being done to deliver on the programmeÂs workforce expansion aim:
Â a detailed analysis of the complex position between now and April 2015 of the key factors that will deliver service expansion: training intake; course attrition; trainee conversion rate to employment; participation rate in employment; net turnover (leavers); and other supply into employment,
Â a menu of interventions to improve each of the factors above to maximise FTEs in the workforce (including an additional, final March 2014 training cohort),

High user satisfaction ratings and strong support from the National Stakeholder Engagement Group and National NHSmail Forum suggests a desire to continue a secure email service for the NHS in some form. The continuation of a need, along with a number of other key infrastructure projects, was confirmed in a DH announcement on 22nd September 2011. 

The existing NHSmail contract was executed on 1st July 2004 for a 9 year term which is now due to expire on 30th June 2014 with the recent contract extension. The currently contracted supplier for this service is Cable & Wireless Worldwide. 

The aim of the NHSmail2 project is therefore to identify a solution and replace this existing service, with the new service being phased in throughout 2015.

The project is working with the Crown Commercial Service to set up and run a Managed Email Framework which will be available to the wider public sector. The OJEU for this was released on the 20/02/14, the framework being able to be procured from on the 30/06/14.

The Project will run a further competition on suppliers which are on the framework to select an NHSmail supplier. This is currently scheduled for the 02/10/14.

The SMS element is being procured via the G-Cloud framework, with a view to SMS being devolved to local procurements and funding in March 15.","All actions from the MPA Gateway 2 review in June 13 have been addressed. The major points covered in these recommendations were on clarifying the procurement approach with Government Digital Services (GDS). The procurement is now underway using a dedicated managed email framework.

Other recommendations centred on project controls and resourcing which have now been addressed.

Clarification of the security level of the solution was also flagged, this has now been done and agreed with the Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG).

Lastly It was identified that there was a need to clarify the situation regarding supplying NHSmail accounts to Any Qualified Providers (AQPs). The Outline Business Case (OBC) outlines the approach for AQPS - increased inclusion - this has now been approved by HMT.",29/03/2012,18/11/2014,Since the publication of the GMPP Q2 13/14 the project timescales have slipped.,0.83,1.44,157.38,"Whilst the budgeted figures are based upon the HMT approved SOC, the forecast  figures are based upon the NHSmail2 Outline Business which was at this point going through the approvals process.

This programme is being delivered by CSC (Computer Sciences Corporation) as the Local Service Provider (LSP).

The CSC contract consists of a number of Strategic Products aimed at different healthcare professionals working across multiple care settings.  Where these Strategic Products were not sufficiently developed to provide all of the required functionality and benefits associated with them at the time required for deployment, a number of Interim Products were made available to NHS organisations for implementation.  The Products will replace outdated legacy systems and manual processes for the capture of clinical information, enabling a number of benefits to providers, including; reducing the reliance on paper based process, improving safety of care and increasing operational efficiency and effectiveness.  These Strategic and Interim Products will remain for the duration of the contract:

80,Public Services Network for Health (PSNH),DoH,Red,"The project will deliver a  Wide Area Network (WAN) to support the needs of health and care in delivering business critical services and systems. Currently, N3 gives pervasive access to health to a range of national applications and N3 services such as VOIP and Video Conferencing and is fundamental to NHS service delivery. The deployment of a future WAN on the expiration of N3 (currently March 31st 2014) is essential for ensuring health and care is able to deliver services and quality care to patients. Furthermore, the information sharing needs across the public sector are growing exponentially.

This investment will deploy a compliant Public Services Network for Health which will not only ensure interworking within health and care but also between the wider public sector. This will also enable access to the legacy N3 infrastructure during transition which will ensure health and care can transition from N3 to PSNH without loss of service, it is envisaged transition will last up to 3 years.

The specific objectives are:

Â To underpin the Information Strategy by permitting the flow of electronic information between health and social care organisations.
Â To comply with government policies for the use of shared services.
Â To recognise and support health and care providersÂ choice in their ICT by enabling devolved infrastructure procurement.
Â To facilitate a private network that meets information security standards.
Â To enable flexible communications infrastructure.
Â To provide continuity of Service
","PSNH was rated RED Delivery Confidence at MPA Gateway 2 Review. While progress has been made against the recommendations, Delivery Confidence remained RED due to the dependency upon the N3 programme to achieve extension.
N3 Delivery Confidence was RED as the extension business case has failed to gain approval. Any approval to spend from 1st April for N3 became contingent upon moving into the termination period provided for in the contract and agreeing a revised commercial position with BT.
In addition, a clear agreement on future strategic intent was needed before the approval for N3 could be granted.
To ensure PSNH can deliver successfully, continuity of service for the current N3 was  necessary, to enable the requisite time for procurement and implementation. Therefore, due to N3 having a Delivery Confidence of RED for the current service and the delivery of the revised business case, PSNH Delivery Confidence was also stated as RED.
N3 has subsequently moved into transition and funding has been approved. Agreement on the future strategic intent for health and care networking has also been agreed with the Cabinet Office as part of the approval; the PSNH programme is now working to achieve the commitments made by the end of June 2014.
Delivery Confidence rating remains RED as any future approvals for PSNH are contingent on ensuring the commitments within the strategic intent are evaluated and progressed by the end of June 2014.

81,Summary Care Record (SCR),DoH,Amber/Green,"The Summary Care Record supports patient care by providing healthcare staff in urgent and emergency care settings with the essential medical information they need to support safe treatment. The SCR includes a defined set of key patient data for every patient in England except those who choose not to have one. The over arching aim is that the SCR will contain only significant aspects of a personÂs care, those deemed to deliver benefit to a patient when receiving urgent and emergency care. 

When a patientÂs SCR is first created it will contain details of: Medications; Adverse reactions; and, Allergies from the patient's GP record. 

Patients have a choice to opt out of the SCR at any time and must give permission for clinicians to view their SCR. To support this, a SCR public information programme involves making patients and NHS healthcare staff aware of the SCR. This includes sending a personalised information pack to all GP registered patients, over the age of 16. ","The Patient Information Pack process has been fully completed.

The implementation trajectory for record uploads and sites going live for viewings has been re-forecast due to the knock on effect from the change from Primary Care Trusts (PCT) to Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG).

82,South Acute Programme,DoH,Amber,"The South Acute Programme was established by the Southern Programme for IT Board in Autumn 2011 to deliver clinical systems for Acute providers in the South of England that did not receive services from the Local Service Provider (LSP) contract. The systems, procured locally by providers through this programme, will replace outdated legacy systems and manual processes for the capture of clinical information, enabling a number of benefits to providers, including; reducing the reliance on paper based process, improving safety of care and increasing operational efficiency and effectiveness.  

Providers are working in 6 collaborative groups, each with their own scope, in order to procure and implement systems aligned to local informatics strategy and priorities, with DH providing some central funding to support these local investments.   The service/system scope of each collaborative comprises: 
Group A - Electronic Prescribing and Medicines Administration (EPMA); 
Group B - Electronic Document Management and a Clinical Portal; 
Group C - Community-wide ePrescribing  
Group D - An enhanced Patient Administration System and a Maternity system; 
Group E - An Integrated Clinical Information System; and 
Group F - Clinical Document Management.","Following the last Gateway Review (Dec 2012), five of the six recommendations made have been closed.

All relevant actions against each recommendation are now complete. The remaining recommendation relates to each Trust to create clear benefit baselines; each Trust provided a calculation and assumptions in the central Outline Business Case stage, and each Trust will  finalise their baseline in their collaborative Full Business Case (FBC).

90,Seasonal Flu Extension to Children Programme,DoH,Amber/Red,"Influenza is a viral infection of the respiratory system.  For some people, especially older people, young infants and people with underlying health conditions, it can cause serious even life-threatening complications and death. The impact of influenza on the population varies widely from year to year due to changes in the virus. However, one recent estimate considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisations (JCVI) suggest that each year, on average, approximately 0.75 million people may consult their GP, approximately 27, 000 people may be hospitalised and 4, 700 people may die in England because of influenza. Currently the programme provides influenza vaccination on the NHS for people aged 65 years and older and those aged under 65 with certain underlying health conditions (e.g. those with chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, pregnant women etc). 

JCVI has recommended that the current flu programme is extended to children aged 2 to less than 17 years. DH has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution , to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective. The evidence reviewed by JCVI suggests that the extension to the current seasonal flu programme might result in around a 40% reduction in the death and hospitalisation figures shown above across the population, although there is large uncertainty either way in this estimate.  For this reason, JCVI recommends that the impact and cost effectiveness of the extended programme be reviewed within five years of the introduction to assess whether the expected benefits have been realised.

When fully introduced this will be the largest immunisation programme offered in the UK, offering vaccine to more than 9 million children every autumn.  The programme is therefore being phased in to allow time to build up capacity and adopt learning from early pilots.
","The Project Assessment Review (PAR) in October 2013 gave a red/amber rating. An action plan was produced, agreed and ratified through the Childhood Flu Implementation Board and action taken to address concerns from the MPA. As the scope of the programme has now changed considerably from the original proposal, it was agreed that the Action Plan should be signed off and a full Gate 4 Delivery review would be held in Q2 2014.",03/09/2013,01/09/2017,"The scale of the programme has not changed; a national programme with up to 9.5 million children to be vaccinated when fully rolled out. The pace of the roll out has been scaled down over years 14/15, 15/16

h) manage the impact of workforce across radiotherapy services. ","Following the MPA Delivery Confidence Assessment rating of Amber/Red, a detailed Management Action Plan was developed in consultation with the key Programme stakeholders which identified specific actions to be taken to address the findings from the MPA Review. 
Due to the complexity and unique nature of the Programme, targeted actions were implemented leading to: 

1. Changes in the leadership and governance arrangements for the Programme to enhance the overall robustness by supporting the delivery and effective management of the current phase which largely involves procurement of the equipment, assurance and securing the necessary Government approvals. 
2. A revamp of the Programme environment providing clarity to where accountability and responsibilities lies at the various tiers of the National Programme, for example, 

o DH is providing leadership and responsible for:
i. Capital Funding
ii. Programme management and delivery
iii. Approvals and assurance using mandatory Cabinet Office and HM Treasury processes.  

o NHS England is providing leadership and responsible for:
i. Commissioning
ii. Clinical Services and Referrals
iii. Mobilisation of PBT Services
iv. Clinical Policy development
v. Benefits Management and Realisation
vi. Engagement with key stakeholders including the Devolved Nations and professional organisations
vii. Research and Development. 

3. Improvements in the resource levels including confirmation of the core Programme team and use of subject matter experts in specific areas such as the role of a national clinical lead for PBT, workforce strategy and development, and communications.
4. Structured and coordinated stakeholder engagement Â in particular, the establishment of a National PBT Special Interest Group (SIG) with the active participation of the relevant Clinical Reference Groups (CRGs); Health Education England (HEE); professional organisations such as The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR), The Society and College of Radiographers (SCoR), Institute for Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM). In addition, the Programme also has access to the expertise of specialists in the related fields relevant to developing a national PBT service in England. 

Early work has commenced to develop a national plan for the clinical management of patients who have been clinically assessed to benefit from PBT treatment. Part of this work involves the review and expansion of the clinical indications list via the new NHS England processes through the development of clinical policies by engaging with the relevant CRGs as a longer term strategy for the viability of a National PBT service. 
The culmination of these actions has put the Programme on a much improved pedestal in terms of governance, resources, communications, stakeholder engagement and the plans towards the delivery of sustainable benefits. ",01/01/2012,01/12/2018,The PBT Programme remains on schedule to treat first patients in Manchester and London during 2018.

The Trusts will charge this to NHS England. NHS England has identified an allocation of budget from the Overseas Programme to cover this cost. Furthermore, budgeted capital spend has been re-phased in line with the final version of the Trust OBCs. Actual capital drawdowns have fallen below this due to slower than expected spend caused by different procurement routes for The Christie building procurement and some forecast error. The delay in spend doesn't reflect slippage in meeting programme milestones. As a result spend now shows as under budget in 2013/14.",Whole life costs have not changed significantly. There is now a slight reduction due to a later service commencement date assumed in the final Trust OBCs (ramp up commences one quarter later).

94,Benefit Cap,DWP,Amber/Green,"From April 2013, the Government introduced a cap on the total amount of benefit that working-age people can receive so that households on out-of-work benefits will no longer receive more in welfare payments than the average weekly wage for working households.     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Benefit payments for individual households are capped at Ĺ500 per week for couples (with or without children) and single parent households; and at Ĺ350 per week for single adult households without children. This is around the average earned income after tax and national insurance deductions for working households.
","The project successfully implemented the benefit cap, with phased implementation starting from April 2013. National implementation was completed by the end of September 2013. The actions recommended to the project by the MPA were already part of the existing implementation plan and were necessarily delivered as part of successful implementation. 

The benefit cap has now been rolled out to all Local Authorities across the country

To January 2014 over 38,600 households had been capped, with almost 11,000 no longer capped (28%).  Of those households no longer capped around 40% have gone into work, as indicated by the number of open working tax credit claims.

The costs mainly encompass; DWP Project Team resource, upfront employment support for those claimants potentially being capped (of whom 36,000 accepted employment support and over 19,000 moved into employment), the introduction of a new Benefit Cap IT system to manage the capping of cases, additional LA costs for administering the pathfinder sites from April 2013 and ongoing DWP and LA staff resource for processing cases appropriate to be capped.

103,Work Programme,DWP,Amber,"The GovernmentÂs Coalition Agreement gave a commitment to ""create a single welfare to work programme to help all unemployed people get back into work"". The Work Programme, which has been in place nationally since June 2011, does this by providing an integrated package of back-to-work support for a range of claimants - from JobseekerÂs Allowance (JSA) recipients who have been out of work for some time, to claimants who may have received Employment Support Allowance (ESA) or Incapacity Benefits. 

The innovative features of the Work Programme include: 
1) Payment largely by results, for the first time 
2) A long-term focus Â once a claimant is referred to a Work Programme prime provider, they remain with that provider for 2 years 
3) Differential pricing Â payments up to Ĺ14,000 for getting those with the biggest barriers to employment into sustained work 
4) A process that is not prescribed Â providers are given the freedom to innovate and use what works best.
","The performance of the programme has significantly improved since the first year.  Official statistics published in December 2013 showed that 208,000 jobseekers have escaped long-term unemployment and found lasting work (normally at least 6 months) through the Work Programme.

Since the launch, the Department has taken, and continues to take, clear and robust action to drive up the performance of the programme and ensure the expected benefits are realised. This has included: placing 12 contracts under Performance Improvement Notices in June 2013; shifting market share to better performing providers in August 2013; and most recently, in March 2014, issuing notice of termination to one contract. 

It is not possible at this time to judge the overall impact of the programme, however a formal impact assessment is planned to be conducted in early 2015.

o an extra 250,000 Work Experience or Sector-Based Work Academy places over the three years, ensuring that there is an offer of a Work Experience place for every 18 to 24 year-old who wants one, before they enter the Work Programme;

105,Automatic Enrolment Programme (originally called Enabling Retirement Savings Programme),DWP,Amber,"The overarching aim of the GovernmentÂs workplace pension reforms is to get more people saving more for their retirement. The Automatic Enrolment Programme Âwent liveÂ in October 2012, delivering:   
1) Automatic enrolment - a new duty on employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme, and an incentive to remain saving in a pension scheme through a mandatory employer contribution.
2) The National Employment Savings Trust Â to offer low cost pension provision to individuals on low to moderate earnings and their employers. NEST must accept any employer who wishes to use it to meet their employer duty. 
3) A proportionate compliance regime - run by the Pension Regulator to support these measures. 

The implementation period for the Programme runs to 6 years. Employers subject to the new duty are being 'staged' in by size, starting with the largest, over the period October 2012 to February 2018. Contributions to pension schemes will be phased in over time to provide a period of adjustment for employers and individuals, with full contributions being paid from October 2018. 
Once fully implemented, between 6 to 9 million people are forecast to be newly saving, or saving more, into a workplace pension.
","The early implementation results are very encouraging. As at March 2014, over three million people had been automatically enrolled in to a workplace pension, with high levels of compliance observed amongst those employers who have staged so far, and opt-out rates amongst employees much lower than expected. As implementation progresses through the staging dates to medium and micro employers, the ProgrammeÂs challenges may change. To help manage this there is an extensive programme of research and stakeholder engagement, both to track observed behaviours and to gain first-hand knowledge of how the reforms are playing out on the ground.

The secondary objectives are to develop and implement a strategy for the Legacy systems and schemes ensuring that scheme year 2013/14 can be completed properly and scheme year 2014/15 can be supported; to enable the satisfactory transition from current solutions during the 2014/15 scheme year; and to meet the remaining audit requirements. It will facilitate options for organisational change in the medium term for the Delivery Bodies that administer CAP schemes. The Programme will focus on (i) identifying the preferred solution for the future CAP schemes covering both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2; (ii) procuring the preferred solution in time for the implementation of the reformed CAP; and (iii) successfully managing transition for customers from existing schemes and delivering an improved customer experience aligned with HM Government digital strategy. 
The two key strategic drivers are (i) the need to improve the quality of services provided by Defra Delivery Bodies to their customers (also ensuring good value for money); and (ii) to operate new schemes which have emerged from CAP2013 reforms.
","The Amber/Red rating reflects the inherent high level of risk due to the nature of this digital exemplar programme, coupled with a review of the programme delivery approach by the Senior Responsible Owner (in Summer 2014).  A new SRO was appointed (October 2014)  and additional senior and specialist resource from the Government Digital Service was brought in to enhance the application of the Agile delivery model used by the programme. The scope and timelines for deliverables were thoroughly reviewed to better align with business needs which mitigated some of the risk in delivery.   

However, at the beginning of 2015 the programme encountered significant challenges in delivering to time and quality some of the key IT functionality required for a fully Digital By Default service.   Launch of the Pillar 1 Basic Payments Scheme (BPS) in April 2015 using the online portal mapping capability was considered too high risk and a contingency plan was invoked to allow customers to submit their BPS claims in 2015 through a number of other channels after registering on the online service.  A similar approach is being developed for Pillar 2 Countryside Stewardship applications in 2015.

32,Thames Estuary Programme Phase 1 (TEP1),DEFRA,Green,"The Environment AgencyÂs Thames Estuary 2100 (TE2100) Plan provides a strategy for protecting London and the Thames Estuary from tidal flooding to the year 2100 and beyond.  This is work to maintain and improve the existing system of flood risk assets, including the Thames Barrier and associated gates and the 350km of walls and embankments. The cost of maintaining and improving these flood risk assets is justified by the high value of assets protected. Over 1.25million people live and work in the tidal flood plain and  200bn of property is at risk. Other assets at risk include four World Heritage sites, the centre of national government and the London Underground as well as other key sites of national and international importance. 
The TE2100 Plan sets out the Environment AgencyÂs short, medium and long-term programmes of investments and other recommended actions to manage tidal flood risk through to the end of this century and into the 22nd century.  The Plan is based on a managed adaptive approach which ensures that the right investments are made at the right time allowing for adjustments to be made in timing of works on the actual impacts of sea level rise.  The TE2100 Strategic Outline Programme, which describes the delivery of the programme through a number of phases, was approved by Defra and HMT in 2012. 
This report relates to the first package of works within the strategy Â the Thames Estuary Phase 1 (now re-named Thames Estuary Asset Management 2100 Programme).

This is unacceptable on environment and health grounds. The proposed Thames Tideway Tunnel is the most cost effective, comprehensive and timely solution to address the problem of combined sewer overflows into the Thames in London, and is due for completion in 2023. In principle the duty to build the Thames Tideway Tunnel falls to Thames Water (who lead the project) and oversight of customer interests falls to Ofwat.

40,High Speed Rail Programme,DfT,Amber/Red,"HS2 is the Government project to build a new North-South railway.  The case for the new line rests on the capacity and connectivity it will provide. We need this capacity because our railways are increasingly busy and in the future, as our economy and our population grows, we will travel even more. We need the connectivity because bringing people together drives economic growth. Our current transport system is already under strain and a constraint on growth. Among the many alternatives that have been considered Â including new motorways and upgrades to the current rail network - HS2 is the best way of getting ahead of current demand on our core transport network. 

The new north-south railway is a long term solution to a long term problem. Without it the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main Lines are likely to be overwhelmed. With it, we will transform intercity travel, radically improve commuter services into London and our other major cities and increase the amount of rail freight. 

These transport improvements will help support economic growth and make a major contribution towards rebalancing the economy.
The new railway will be built in two phases. It will be fully integrated with the rest of the railway network. It will bring benefits to places with stations on the new railway including Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and London; to stations on the classic network like Liverpool, Darlington and Newcastle which will receive high speed services; and to other places on the existing mainlines like Milton Keynes, Rugby and Peterborough which will have better services from released capacity on the existing main lines","The High Speed 2 programme remains in a strong position and continues to make significant progress. 
On Resourcing:
There has been significant progress on building capability in the programme as we transition towards the delivery phase. We have made key appointments to senior roles at DfT and HS2 Ltd including:
Â Simon Kirby, Chief Executive, HS2 Ltd Â May 2014
Â Alistair Kirk, Programme and Strategy Director, HS2 Ltd Â September 2014
Â Jonathan Crone, PMO Director, HS2 Ltd - January 2015
DfT and Network Rail and HS2 Ltd have each grown their project teams, bringing in the skills and capability required for the next phase of work.
On Phase 1 Hybrid Bill and timetable:
The hybrid Bill for Phase One (London-West Midlands) was deposited on time and achieved resounding support at its Second Reading in April 2014 with a majority of 452 to 41 demonstrating the strong cross party support for the scheme.  Good progress has been made in hearing petitions and, by March 2015, 344 petitioners had been heard by the Bill Committee and a further 99 petitioners had withdrawn or will not appear on account of agreed changes or assurances received from the Secretary of State, along with 22 who were denied standing by the Committee.  
The Secretary of State announced in Parliament that the working assumption was that the Hybrid Bill would achieve Royal Assent in late 2016. A carry-over motion was successfully passed that will allow the BillÂs work to be carried over into the next Parliament.  The target opening date for Phase 1 remains unchanged for 2026.
On governance and the transition to the next phase:
Governance arrangements have been developed to formalise tripartite working between DfT, HS2 Ltd and Network Rail.  Board structures have been reviewed and the new structures have been operating successfully for some months. 
A Development Agreement was signed by DfT and HS2 Ltd on 8 December 2014 formalising the relationship between DfT and HS2 Ltd in developing and delivering the HS2 railway and associated work.  A new client board, chaired by the SRO, has been put in place to manage the performance of HS2 Ltd against this Development Agreement.
The creation of an integrated Programme Management Office, under the responsibility of the new HS2 Ltd Programme & Strategy Director, is in hand. 
We are making good progress on preparations towards construction:   HS2 Ltd held two further supply chain conferences, in London on 17 October 2014 and in Manchester on 23 October 2014, to discuss the commercial opportunities with the supply chain and inform the procurement strategy and approach for the programme. 
Phase 2 (Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds)
On 27 October 2014 Sir David Higgins released his second report on HS2, ÂRebalancing BritainÂ.  This confirming that the strategic goal for Phase Two linking Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds is right; the East Midlands and South Yorkshire stations are best for the regions and the existing network; a hub station at Crewe would serve the local region and the North West; Leeds station must match the cityÂs vision and its transport needs; and that work needs to continue on the best route for an East/West connection in the North (ÂHS3Â), how and when it could be constructed, and its cost. 
In response to Sir DavidÂs report, the Government confirmed its commitment to the Y Network.

Â HS2 property compensation package Â On 16 January 2015 the Secretary of State announced the GovernmentÂs package of measures to help owner occupiers along the line of route for Phase One of High Speed 2, from London to the West Midlands.  
Â ResidentsÂ Charter & Commissioner Â 16 January 2015 also saw HS2 Ltd launch a ResidentsÂ Charter to help ensure that residents are treated in a fair, clear, competent and reasonable manner.  A new ResidentsÂ Commissioner overseeing the charter, Deborah Fazan, will ensure that HS2 Ltd meets its commitments set out in the new charter.
Â Strategic Environmental Assessment Judgement Â On 25 November 2014 the Court of Appeal found in the GovernmentÂs favour by agreeing with the High CourtÂs previous judgment that a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) was not required before making safeguarding directions to protect the planned route for Phase One of HS2. The Government has now won 20 out of 21 judicial challenges to the project.
Â Safeguarding the Route between Fradley and Crewe - The consultation on safeguarding the route between Fradley and Crewe was launched on 4 November 2014 and closed on 6 January 2015. 105 responses were received, which are being analysed to support a ministerial decision later this year.  
Wider Benefits
Â Growth and Regeneration Â The Growth Taskforce published its report ÂHS2: get readyÂ on 21 March 2014. This set out a number of recommendations on ensuring the whole country shares in the job and business opportunities HS2 will deliver. ÂGetting set for HS2: responding to the HS2 Growth TaskforceÂ was published on 24 July 2014 setting out how Government and HS2 Ltd will work with local areas and businesses to ensure the wider economic growth benefits of HS2 are maximised. The recommendations have been progressed and, as part of this, Greater Birmingham and Solihull were awarded funding for 2015/16 to support the development of local plans for HS2-related growth/connectivity.

Following the latter procurement process, three preferred bidders were chosen in late 2011 and Competitive Dialogue started in February 2012. Dialogue concluded and final tenders were received, evaluated and Preferred Bidder announced in December 2012. The Full Business Case was approved by the DfT Board Investment & Commercial Committee (BICC), Ministers and HM Treasury by 15 February 2013. On 28 February, the contract was awarded to arvato (part of the Bertlesman Group).

","The overall Programme schedule had been delayed due to issues identified during user testing of the system. However, since September 2014 good progress has been made, following an updated delivery plan introduced in August 2014.

47,Better Care Fund,DoH Non Capital,Amber/Red,"Â Demographic change creates unprecedented challenge. In just 15 yearsÂ time, the number of over-65s will have grown 50% and the number of over-85s will have doubled. The fact that a child born in Britain today has a one in three chance of reaching 100 years of age means this challenge will only get harder.

Â Ministers therefore concluded that, to ensure the sustainability of the care we provide, we have to change our focus from simply treating illnesses, to keeping people well and living independently for as many years as possible and integrate our health and social services.

Â To drive this they have decided to pool budgets between CCGs and Local Authorities to encourage them to work together and drive the integration agenda forward.  

Â Local areas first submitted their BCF plans (detailing how pooled budgets would be planned to be spent in that area) in April 2014. However the quality and aspiration of these plans was not as expected and as a consequence the BCF Task Force was set up on the 7th of July 2014 to work with local areas to improve the quality of plans, assess them and provide assurance to ministers. 

The objective of the policy is to accelerate the local integration of health and care services to deliver better outcomes for patients and service users. 

The Task Force has a narrow focus and its objectives are as follows: 

Â Oversee creation of, assurance and sign off plans across the country which utilise the opportunity of the pooled funds to best effect and support achievement of the purpose;
Â Support the system to prepare for delivery of plans

By the end of October 2014 all 151 plans will have been assessed and assured against the agreed set of national conditions. They will be given an assessed status of either: approved; approved with support; approved with conditions; or not approved.
The assessment and assurance process will seek to deliver plans that will include:
Â A clear analytically driven (i.e. risk stratified) understanding of where care can be improved by integration (of budgets, commissioning, care processes or services)
Â A clear and evidence based plan of action, developed with all local stakeholders (CCG, LA, HWBB, NHSE, acute and non-acute providers and primary care providers)
Â A coherent and believable delivery chain with clear local management and accountability arrangements  
Â A credible way of tracking the impact of interventions, and taking remedial action as necessary
Â P4P mechanisms that are agreed and support delivery of the SR settlement and NHS settlement

Given that not all plans will achieve fully approved status, it has already been proposed and approved by the Task Force Programme Board that the Task Force be extended beyond October to support areas to get their plans to a fully approved state and help areas prepare for April. 

The Task Force is currently scoping this Phase 2 of activity which will run from November 2014 through to March 2015. Phase 2 will include the following objectives: 
Â To have the majority of plans fully approved and ready for implementation
Â To align the BCF plans with BAU NHS and Local Government planning processes
Â Support local areas to prepare for and focus on the delivery of BCF plans
Â Communicate a strong narrative to the public, and health and social care staff on the value of Integrated Care
Â Alignment with other health and social care integration initiatives
Â Prepare for and take part in longer term policy development such as the next spending review

Task Force Phase 2 benefits are still being analysed however they are expected to include the raising of the profile of the integrated care agenda with the public and health and social care staff, and a level of assurance around the strength of the implementation of plans in local areas in preparation for April 1st 2015. 

Post March 2015 there will still be much work to be done in order to release the benefits to patient care that the Better Care Fund aims for. CCGs and Local Authorities are free to use their share of the funding to promote integration as they see fit. However, they should meet some national conditions to ensure a minimum level of consistency throughout England. Conditions include ensuring 7 day health and social care services, preventing unnecessary hospital admissions and reducing delayed transfers of care, to making sure one lead professional is accountable for all of a personÂs care throughout the new integrated system. 

It is currently unclear whether post March 2015 work will be overseen and monitored via existing structures within Local Government and the NHS or if there will be some requirement for further work or support from a central team such as the Task Force. 

The current Task Force currently has no scope or remit post March 2015. 

","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Red at Q2 2014.                                     
There were major risks and issues that are apparent in a number of areas around plan submittal and quality and aspirations around plans: 
1) The timescales set for local areas to submit plans which are of the required quality and aspiration are challenging which may lead to the number of plans that are 'not approved' being larger than what was hoped for by many stakeholders
2) The timescales during which the Task Force could provide support to areas was short therefore there was a risk that plans may not substantially change in quality from the previous submission
3) The local settings in which plans were being developed were complex with many and varied stakeholders (social care, local Government, NHS, HWBs, CCGs) and development of a robust and quality plan requires agreement across sectors
All of these issues and risks were actively managed and actions included:
Â Plan improvement support over the summer for local areas included webinars, regional clinics, practical guides and intensive hands on support. 
Â A Governance Structure to feed key decisions was set up and included regular meetings with the SoS Health, a X Ministerial Board and BCF Programme Board. 
Â Three Checkpoints gave some visibility of area readiness to submit plans and the results were fed  into support arrangements, with any changes being made that were appropriate
Â Five Fast Track areas submitted plans at the end of August and were Âapproved with supportÂ via the National Consistent Assurance Review process (NCAR).
Â All remaining BCF plans were submitted and went through the NCAR process, receiving approval statuses. 
Â The Taskforce was extended to continue into Phase 2, running from the end of October to the end of March. The objectives for this phase were to plan and develop the detail for support offerings and assurance for local areas post NCAR results.
Progress to date:
Since Q2, all plans not fully approved in October have been resubmitted following the delivery of support to areas not fully approved: areas in the 'approved' and 'approved with support' categories were mainstreamed into NHS England and LG mechanisms to enable them to progress with implementation. Those areas in the 'approved with conditionsÂ and Ânot approvedÂ categories worked with a team of Better Care Advisors and experts from a PA-led consortium to support them to strengthen their plans, break through issues and resubmit plans.
As of 26th January 2015, of 150 plans: 120 have been fully ÂApprovedÂ; 4 are categorised as ÂApproved with SupportÂ; the remaining 26 plans have been resubmitted and are currently undergoing the Nationally Consistent Assurance Process with a formal outcome on the 6th February. An escalation process is in place for areas who fail to reach either ÂApprovedÂ or ÂApproved with SupportÂ categories in this final wave of resubmissions. 
A KMPG-led consortia of experts has been engaged to lead implementation support nationally, with support being led regionally by NHS England regional leads with local government colleagues.
The current Taskforce currently has no scope or remit post March 2015 but work is underway to develop plans for a core team, resourced jointly by NHS England, DCLG, DH and LGA, to continue supporting the success of the Better Care Fund centrally. 
",07/07/2014,31/03/2015,"The planned schedule from Q2 has been kept, with additional milestones added as Phase 2 has progressed. Key milestones achieved have been putting in place remedial arrangements and support for areas unable to sign off a plan of sufficient quality/ambition, reviews undertaken for area plans in October and the majority of plans reaching approved status by January 2015.

Phase 2 of the Taskforce was an extension not initially planned for when the TaskForce was first set up. The extension developed in order to allow the TaskForce to fulfil its objectives and coordinate continuing support required by a number of areas facing challenges in submitting plans of the required detail and quality, as well as to ensure that the appropriate implementation support and planning was in place in the run up to April 2015.

The actual cost of Phase 1 was  3.86m. 
The scope for Phase 2, running from 31st October to 31st March, was still being developed in detail in Q2 and dependent on 1) An understanding of the number of areas whose plans are approved with conditions, approved with support or not approved in September as this will impact the shape and size of any Task Force provided support in Phase 2 2) The feedback from Programme Board and Stakeholders over the coming weeks as the scope for Phase 2 is socialised with them.

51,BT LSP (South),DoH Non Capital,Amber/Red,"The purpose of the BT Local Service Provider South  programme is to support IT enabled transformation in the NHS in the South to create a more efficient, joined-up and patient-led health service.  The key objectives of the programme are to:
- Provide patients with more choice and control over their patient records
- Create a health service centred around the patient with health information following patients where they are receiving treatment
- Provide health professionals and patients with better access to information and enhance the quality of clinical information so that decisions about patient care and treatment can be made quickly and efficiently based on secure and up-to-date healthcare records.
- Help health professionals deliver better patient care by improving the way NHS staff connect  with each other across organisational boundaries and provide them with faster, easier access to reliable electronic patient information 
- transform the way information flows around the health service and help to provide improved and innovative patient services in the South.

All IT deployments and upgrades are now complete and the programme is working to i) maximise the benefits that customer NHS Trusts derive from these systems and ii) work with NHS Trusts and suppliers to ensure a safe and orderly exit from the BT Local Service Provider arrangements in advance of contract end on 31 October 2015.

52,care.data,DoH Non Capital,Red,"The NHS has some of the best information systems in the world. Since the 1980s, we have been collecting information about every hospital admission, nationwide. This information is brought together at the Health and Social Care Information Centre, where it is anonymised. The information has been invaluable for monitoring the quality of hospital care, for planning NHS services, and for conducting research into new treatments. Whilst we have this type of information for some care provided outside hospitals, there are significant gaps meaning that it is not possible to see a complete picture of the care that individuals receive. NHS England has therefore commissioned a programme on behalf of the NHS, public health and social care services to address these gaps. Known as the care.data programme, this initiative will ensure that there is more rounded information available to citizens, patients, clinicians, researchers and the people that plan health and care services. Our aim is to ensure that the best possible evidence is available to improve the quality of care for all.
           ","The MPA RAG rating was Red at Q2 2014.
In February 2014, NHS England announced a six month extension to the proposed roll out of the care.data programme in order to raise awareness, listen and act on the views of patients, health professionals and key stakeholders, and to discuss both the benefits and risks involved. This enabled time to be taken to raise awareness of the benefits of data sharing for purposes beyond direct care and the safeguards in place to secure patient data and to ensure the public are aware of their choices and are informed on how they can Âopt outÂ of care.data should they wish to do so. The outcome of the engagement was the message that clarity was required about how personal information would be used, what information would be collected and how patients would be communicated to on their right to Âopt outÂ.  Additionally, it was clear that consideration should be given to the support required by GP practices to meet the fair processing requirements and successfully communicate these messages to support the introduction of care.data, and to implement care.data through a phased roll-out. The first stage of this phased roll out will take the form of a discovery stage working with up to 250 pathfinder GP practices. This approach will allow NHS England and the Health and Social Care Information Centre to work with a smaller number of GP practices to ensure that the programme understands what is required to support GP practices in meeting fair processing responsibilities and ensure patients are aware of how their data will be used and the choices available to them - this is referred to as the pathfinder stage. The Âpathfinder stageÂ has been established as a project within the care.data programme, it will provide key information from which the programme team can learn and assess the impact before progression into a wider roll-out. No data will be extracted from GP practice systems Â including during the ÂpathfinderÂ until such time that the national data guardian is satisfied.

The Cabinet Office's Major Projects Authority rated delivery confidence as Red in view of the Programme needing to clarify, agree and communicate the programme scope; appoint a full-time Senior Responsible Owner; reconstitute the Programme Board with a clear role and responsibilities; approve explicit go/no go criteria; agree and clarify finances; assign owners to key risks; and recruit key personnel.
Action taken by the Programme includes changing the Programme Board membership with a clear role, responsibilities and Terms of Reference; scheduled meetings at clear decision points in the programme; Programme Board approved explicit go/no go criteria to ensure that delivery plans are viable before the pilot rollout commences; and priority given to the recruitment of key personnel in order to move forward to a more controlled and stable phase of delivery. 

Care.data plan to achieve the following in order to move towards an improved rating for the programme:
Â Complete the Programme Business Case assurance and approval process;
Â Complete the pathfinder stage of the first phase of the programme and secure approval to proceed to further roll-out;
Â Plan national roll out of the primary care extract to deliver primary-secondary care linked dataset, including development of an outline business case;

53,Care and Support Implementation Programme,DoH Non Capital,Amber/Red,"The Care and Support Reform Programme is the most significant and far-reaching programme of reform in adult social care undertaken in over 65 years.  It will have a profound impact on the way the care and support system works, the responsibilities of local government and partners, and the rights, outcomes and experience of people who need care, carers and their families. 

The 'Caring for our future' White Paper published in July 2012 set out a wide ranging set of proposals that provide the framework for transforming care and support including:  refocusing the care system onto prevention and early intervention;  strengthening integration across the care and wider support system; empowering people through transparent information on the quality of the care; supporting communities and neighbourhoods to play a more active role; embedding person-centred care and supporting carers; creating a vibrant, sustainable market to support choice; a commitment to implement a cap on care costs. The new system will promote peopleÂs well-being by enabling them to prevent and postpone the need for care and support, and put them in control of their lives to pursue opportunities, including education and employment, to realise their potential.

The programme supports realisation of the vision for care and support set out in the White Paper by:
Â delivering the legal framework, including the Care Act 2014, regulations and statutory guidance.
Â ensuring that appropriate local government implementation plans are in place for April 2015 and April 2016 milestones and providing assurance on state of readiness.
Â providing national leadership and practical support for implementation, including communications materials, specifications (e.g. data standard and interoperability requirements) and learning and development.

Implementation of the programme occurs in two phases.  Phase 1, introduced from 1 April 2015, will see the implementation of a large number of generally lower-risk reforms that will have the greatest effect on the provision of care and support.  Phase 2 changes, introduced from 1 April 2016 will see the implementation of a smaller number of higher-risk reforms, related to funding of care and support and the creation the cap on care costs. Together these reforms represent a major change programme across 152 local authorities and their partners. ","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Red at Q2 2014.
Because of the complexity of the Programme and the indirect nature of the delivery mechanisms, as well as the separate and inherent risks to local government arising from fiscal constraint, the Delivery Confidence at this point remains as: Amber/Red. The recent rating reflects strong support and commitment across the system, but also the residual challenges to local authorities and risk profile.  The Amber/Red rating reflects greater complexity, uncertainty and the risk of diversion during 2015.
The Programme has made good progress and 2015/16 delivery is now more secure.  The Care Bill achieved Royal Ascent in May 2014 becoming the Care Act 2014, regulations and guidance underpinning the reforms that come into effect in April 2015 were published in October 2014, including agreement of the funding for local government of the new burdens from the changes. The tripartite partnership between DH, LGA and ADASS at the heart of the programme continues to be a strong one and a major asset to the Programme. The partnership with the LGA and ADASS ensures shared ownership and implementation of a programme management approach to assure delivery.  An assurance and implementation support strategy has been agreed that combines oversight, monitoring and assessment at all levels with a commitment to target resources appropriately to tackle risk.  Steps we have taken to address the risk to date risk include the provision of  19m direct to local authorities to build programme management capacity and support engagement in assurance,  with  4m of funding for local authorities in addition to  2.7m provided to establish nine regional delivery partnerships to support local implementation.  We have also made a significant investment in a range of implementation support products that support local authorities and providers to prepare their workforce for the changes and assist communication.

Good progress has been made with implementation of an action plan to address MPA recommendations, as well as in delivering the Programme Plan.  Programme Management  has been strengthened and lessons from Phase 1 are being applied to reduce risk to delivery for Phase 2.  Improvements in the transition from policy development to implementation have been identified and are being applied to Phase 2.  We recognise the risk that the uncertainty caused by the election and Spending Review may undermine efforts to deliver Phase 2, however we are confident that we are developing plans and contingency options to do everything within our control to manage this uncertainty and encourage preparations to allow implementation Phase 2.   ",04/06/2013,01/12/2016,"Phase 1 delivery is on track for 1 April 2015. A LGA / ADASS stocktake survey completed in September 2014 (prior to delivery of key support products and funding) identified that 97% of councils are very or fairly confident that they will be able to deliver the Care Act reforms from April 2015 and confidence increasing on most measures of progress. Delivery of Phase 2 remains on time for introduction of reforms from 1 April 2016.  Whilst the consultation on the 16/17 reforms has been put back from December 2014, a focused and effective consultation early in 2015 will allow the timetable for Phase 2 to stay on track.

We anticipate the forecast / actual spend reported in Q4 will be within 1% variance of budget.  This variance is due to the fact that it does not reflect the funding to local authorities to support them in implementing the Care Act which accounts for approximately a third of the variance.  The majority of grant payments to delivery partners are scheduled for the latter 2 quarters of the year.  Business cases for implementation support products were largely approved between October and December thus this significant area of spend will show in the last quarter.  Additional implementation support to Local Authorities  has been approved since Q2 and Phase 1 of the public awareness campaign has been approved but will not reflect in the figures until the final quarter. ,The costs of the reforms are captured within the impact assessments supporting the White Paper and the draft regulations and guidance published in June 2013 for consultation and in the Funding Reform Impact Assessment published with the draft Care Bill in April 2013. These costs and benefits have been updated to reflect the approved changes in the impact assessment published alongside the regulations and guidance for part 1 of the Care Act that come into effect from 1 April 2015. Figures also capture planned departmental programme spending agreed as part of 2014/15 business planning and projections for future years - which are subject to approval. The costs are quoted in 15/16 prices to be consistent with these impact assessments.,2015.0
54,Childhood Flu Immunisation Programme,DoH Non Capital,Amber,"Influenza is a viral infection of the respiratory system.  For some people, especially older people, young infants and people with underlying health conditions, it can cause serious even life-threatening complications and death. The impact of influenza on the population varies widely from year to year due to changes in the virus. However, one recent estimate considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) suggest that each year, on average, approximately 0.75 million people may consult their GP, approximately 27,000 people may be hospitalised and 4,700 people may die in England because of influenza. Currently the programme provides influenza vaccination on the NHS for people aged 65 years and older and those aged under 65 with certain underlying health conditions (e.g. those with chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, pregnant women etc). 

JCVI has recommended that the current flu programme is extended to children aged 2 to less than 17 years. DH has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution , to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective. The evidence reviewed by JCVI suggests that the extension to the current seasonal flu programme might result in around a 40% reduction in the death and hospitalisation figures shown above across the population, although there is large uncertainty either way in this estimate.  For this reason, JCVI recommends that the impact and cost effectiveness of the extended programme be reviewed within five years of the introduction to assess whether the expected benefits have been realised.

56,Death Certification,DoH Non Capital,Red,"UK wide changes to the death certification process are in development, with England and Wales proposing a unified approach to all deaths not investigated by the coroner.  A new system of scrutiny of deaths to address weaknesses identified by the Shipman Inquiry and more recently among others, the Francis Inquiry into poor care at Mid Staffordshire.  In England and Wales, the introduction of medical examiners into the process will provide independent scrutiny of all deaths not investigated by the coroner.  Medical examiners, appointed by local authorities in England and by local health boards in Wales, will either confirm the cause of death stated by a doctor or refer the death to the coroner for investigation.  For all deaths scrutinised by a medical examiner, the cause of death will be explained to the bereaved and an opportunity offered to raise any concerns, which will be acted upon.   In addition to safeguards for the public, anticipated wider benefits include more accurate certification, better quality of mortality data for service planners, appropriate referral of deaths to the coroner and the ability for doctors and coroners to readily have access to general advice from medical examiners in relation to a particular death.

With 1.7 million prescriptions generated every working day in England and a predicted annual rise of 5 per cent, the Electronic Prescription Service provides an alternative means of generating and processing the growing number of prescriptions.  The NHS Electronic Prescription Service enables prescribers, such as GPs and practice nurses, to send prescriptions electronically to a dispenser (such as a community pharmacy or dispensing appliance contractor) of the patientÂs choice. Dispensing contractors can subsequently send electronic reimbursement endorsement claims to the NHS Prescription Service. 

The main aims of the Electronic Transmission of Prescriptions programme are:
   o To enable the electronic transmission of prescription data in England between:
         - Prescribers (GP, nurses, supplementary);
         - Dispensing contractors (community pharmacy, dispensing doctors and dispensing appliance contractors); and
         - Reimbursement Agencies (e.g. the Business Services AuthorityÂs NHS Prescription Services).
    o  To facilitate the efficient, convenient and accurate dispensing of medication to patients. The scope of the programme covers all primary  care prescribing and dispensing (excluding Schedule 2 and 3 controlled drugs) and supply of medicines, drugs, appliances and chemical reagents by authorised dispensing contractors. Secondary care prescriptions issued for dispensing in the community are also within scope
    o  To enable the NHS Prescription Service to re-engineer their processes to increase capacity and reduce the unit cost of processing prescriptions.

The Electronic Prescription Service has to date delivered Release 2 Phase 3, which allows patients to nominate a pharmacy of their choice, at which to receive their prescription electronically.  The move to Phase 4 will allow a patient to take their prescription token to any pharmacy for dispensing (as they do with their paper prescription today) with the ability to nominate a specific pharmacy continuing for those patients who prefer the service.

Â Restrict its Board membership;
Â Establish a Service Manager for the end to end patient experience;
Â Undertake a risk assessment;
Â Delineates deployment from business as usual;
Â Ensure an effective contract management process;
Â Resolve the controlled drugs and nomination issue; and
Â Appoint a Business Change manager.

The move to Phase 4 has been delayed from April 2015  to allow time to undertake a number of key activities to improve delivery confidence. These are to ensure robust business continuity arrangements are in place, implement a more formal arrangement with dispensing system suppliers, a full review of the service model, more robust patient communications, implementation of schedule 2 & 3 controlled drugs, and consideration of providing refresher training to dispensers. A review of the Programme Board structure and other governance arrangements will also be completed.

Drawing on a range of policy instruments, it combines strong national leadership signals with improved institutional and professional regulation; radical transparency on performance; enhanced arrangements for identifying and addressing failure; improved leadership capability focused on safety and compassion; a stronger voice for patients within the care system; support for staff to raise concerns safely; support for staff to manage more effectively the emotional burden of care.  In short, to transform the culture of the health and care system generally and to give patients a more reliable expectation and experience of high quality care.

Based on the Nuffield study (see http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/ratings-review ), the Ratings regime under development by CQC will be the key instrument for assessing progress against the multiple impacts that the programme is seeking to achieve.  While we and CQC have commissioned evaluation and research to understand better the impacts of the programme on its broad and complex aims, it is unlikely that these will provide a simple assessment of success for the programme or a moment at which a classical programme could close down the work as completed.

Â Develop new IT functionality that responds to the evolving needs of patients, practices and commissioners and the wider NHS. In particular, develop interoperability to deliver information to point of care, provide data to support commissioning and improve care pathway management; and
Â Improve security of patient data by providing practices with the option to migrate to centrally hosted services over the life of this investment.
","The MPA RAG rating was Amber at Q2 2014.
Specific points contributing to the Amber Delivery Confidence assessment will need to be addressed to achieve a green delivery confidence. These are:

Late delivery of Patient Facing Services and other new subsidiary modules under General Practice System of Choice which is likely to reduce the benefit delivered under the framework in 2014/15;

A key objective of the new framework was to open up the market to smaller, subsidiary suppliers but the introduction of new services was delayed due to deficiencies in suppliers' offerings and a lack of HSCIC capacity to perform assurance activity and requirements definition; and

Authority assurance activity for supplier services is being streamlined and requirements are being re-prioritised as mitigation against further delay. The Authority will shortly be revising the contract to reflect the new priorities and target dates for delivery. Suppliers are in the process of responding to ascertain what Principal and Subsidiary offerings (including global switch on) can be achieved by March 2015.

All critical actions were completed after the Gate 4 review in September 2014. 3 essential actions are in progress, 2 of which require Programme Board sign off before they can be closed, which related to the refreshed vision for the service and levers to achieve it.

62,Health Visitor Programme,DoH Non Capital,Amber,"In its 2010 Coalition Agreement, the Government committed to increasing the number of health visitors by an extra 4,200 FTE above the May 2010 baseline by April 2015. Ministers want the extra capacity to bring with it the ability for local teams to improve public health outcomes for the under-fives, with health visitors having the time to provide parents with critical health and development advice, and to connect families to the array of health and wider community resources that help them to give their children the best start in life.  

As part of the GovernmentÂs Health Visitor Programme, a commitment was made to improve the quality of services offered to parents and families in the early years of a childÂs life.  It has been shown that high quality early intervention, prevention and support is vital to giving children the best start in life. The expansion of the health visiting service is intended to deliver a four-tiered model of health visitor delivery of the Healthy Child Programme to all, with support for all parents and early help when needed. It aims to: improve access to evidence-based interventions; improve the experience of children and families; improve health and wellbeing outcomes for under-fives; and ultimately reduce health inequalities.

Commissioning of health visitor services will transfer to Local Authorities on 1 October 2015. It is essential to the sustainability of the programme that commissioning of public health services for 0-5s is effective and embedded alongside the commissioning of other early years services. A multi-agency task and finish group was established in June 2013 to plan and deliver the transfer. This was superseded in September 2014 by a full programme board.","The MPA RAG rating was Amber at Q2 2014.
The following actions are in place to ensure all is being done to deliver on the programmeÂs service transformation and workforce expansion aims, and to safely deliver the transfer of commissioning responsibilities for 0-5s public health services to Local Authorities on 1 October 2015:

Â Ensuring that those who start their health visitor training go on to become health visitors.
Â Reducing the number of health visitors leaving the workforce.
Â Maximising the FTE contribution to the workforce of newly trained health visitors.
Â Ensuring all relevant health visitors are counted properly towards the 4,200 FTE objective.
Â Putting a full programme board in place consisting of members from all key stakeholder groups to oversee delivery of, and manage risks to, the safe transfer of commissioning responsibilities for 0-5s public health services to Local Authorities on 1 October 2015.
Â Publishing Local Authority financial allocations through the Baseline Agreement Exercise.
Â Publishing draft regulations on mandated universal health visitor reviews.
",31/10/2010,31/12/2015,"The programme is on-track with no significant changes to dates of deliverables and key milestones.

Workforce expansion: at the time of preparing this report, the most recent management information (November 2014) published by NHS England estimates an indicative count of 11,290 FTE health visitors; 3,198 more than the May 2010 baseline, representing an increase of 40%. At the time of preparing this report, the latest official figures  (September 2014) show there were 10,800 full time equivalent health visitors; 2,708 more than in May 2010. Since 2010 around 7,500 health visitor training places have been commissioned, with the annual total growing from around 550 to around 2,700 in 2013, representing a five-fold increase in the number of health visitor trainees starting their training.  This investment in training has delivered most of the expansion in health visitor workforce we are now seeing.  In addition, there are a further 1,200 training places being commissioned in 2014/15 - this will ensure that the workforce growth is sustained beyond the end of the programme.

Service transformation: at the time of preparing this report, the new service model has been tested in early implementer  sites and case study material published. These sites saw increases in the numbers of children receiving the 2-2Ë year review almost double.  We have six published priorities for demonstrating success and building sustainable services. Data collection and reporting is in place so that delivery of service transformation can be demonstrated.

Â Annual MPET (Multi-Professional Education and Training) allocations for the service to cover costs of health visitor expansion, including covering salary and training costs and expected costs of training nurses to replace those moving onto the health visitor programme.
Â Specific recruitment, retention and training initiatives in addition to MPET-funded activity to support workforce expansion and service transformation.
Â Delivering the marketing strategy.

The total budgeted whole life costs have remained stable and are thought to be accurate at this point. It should be noted that the total budgeted whole life cost stated in the previous Transparency Report did not include the cumulative costs of expanding the health visitor workforce and was therefore lower than the costs stated in this report. This solely represents a change in the way costs are reported (to increase transparency) and not a change in the costs themselves.",2015.0
63,Liaison and Diversion Programme,DoH Non Capital,Amber,"The aim of the Liaison and Diversion programme is to improve health and criminal justice outcomes for offenders (or suspected offenders) with mental health, substance abuse, personality disorder, learning disabilities and other vulnerabilities.  This should be achieved by investing in Liaison and Diversion services to screen, assess and refer offenders at the earliest possible point of the criminal justice system into relevant treatment and support, so that information from assessments is subsequently fed into the criminal justice process and can be used to inform decisions about justice outcomes, charging, prosecution and sentencing.  This fits with the strategic aims and objectives (offender rehabilitation to support reduced offending, and improved health and wellbeing outcomes) of each of the departments involved.  It is accepted by the Coalition Government that this direction of travel supports the business needs, as it was anticipated that early intervention and investment in health services for offenders across England will save money through reduced ongoing impacts on the criminal justice system.  The programme is led within NHS England, which has responsibility for commissioning L&D services. Policy work is being taken forward by a cross government programme, funded through the SR settlement to DH and involving DH, Ministry of Justice and the Home Office, working with NHS England and Public Health England.

 At the last review MPA found that considerable progress had been made and noted a number of key developments.  These included approval by HMT of the OBC and subsequent ministerial announcement about the programme in January 2014, successful achievement of the key milestones to establish the pilots, developing the data strategy and smooth transition of the programme team from DH to NHS England. There was noted to be visibly stronger commitment at all levels to the programme which was assessed to be in good shape, and the review team sensed that the team was much better placed to successfully deliver the policy goals.  Despite the significant degree of challenge and complexity associated with this programme, the review team found that all recommendations from the previous review had been addressed. It was recognised that more work is still required, particularly regarding ICT, workforce planning, communications and stakeholder engagement to ensure that these areas do not negatively impact the chances for successful delivery.  The AAP Review Team noted that if active management attention was paid to them, there was no reason why the delivery confidence rating should not continue to improve further.
In response to recommendations an ICT and data strategy has been produced, and detailed ICT and data requirements are in the process of being developed with the Health and Social Care Information Centre; a workforce planning project has been initiated with Health Education England to validate workforce assumptions, and to address skills and workforce supply issues;  communications and stakeholder engagement have been strengthened with the production of a series of films focusing on service user experiences, which is published on the NHS England website; service user focus groups and a service user committee have also been put in place.

NHS Choices (www.nhs.uk) is the digital channel for the NHS. It receives over 43m unique visits every month and usage of the site has grown annually since launch. NHS Choices allows users to access comprehensive, clinically valid information on health conditions and information about health and social care services and performance. 

NHS Choices is designed to meet the requirements of those with health or care needs, either directly (e.g. patient or service user) or indirectly (e.g. carer). It will focus on the following objectives responding to core user needs, including:

Â Prevent ill health and promote good health: e.g. I want to improve my health and/or wellbeing or avoid past experiences of poor health;
Â Promote early intervention: e.g. I have a symptom, I need help;
Â Reassure and give confidence: e.g. I have a diagnosis or question related to my care, what do I do;
Â Access to services or treatment: e.g. I need a service, how do I choose and access it; and
Â Motivate: e.g. I have an illness and I am not involved in planning my care.

A programme of transformation is required to develop a service which meets these objectives. The current service has not changed substantively since launch in 2007.

Â         Updating the project plan to deliver NHS e-Referral Service, including ensuring a consolidated critical path (the minimum set of activities and associated durations to complete) was in place to support key decision points;
Â         A revised test plan, to ensure all necessary testing (such as testing the service works, quickly, is secure, etc.) of the service is completed in advance of go live; and
Â         Working with senior users, the Senior Responsible Owner and the Programme Board for the service to agree the quality criteria for acceptance of the new system, and agreement reached to de-prioritise any non essential items for go live.

All MPA critical actions were completed, 3 essential actions are in progress, 2 of which require Programme Board sign off before they can be closed, which related to the refreshed vision for the service and levers to achieve it.  The final action will be closed in March-15, which relates to capacity and capability of the team, with recruitment and other activities underway to close the previously identified gaps.

The path to green for NHS e-Referral Service is focussed on completing go live expediently and safely.  This involves reducing issues with the software, completing test, data migration and service readiness (so the service is supported after go live) activity.

This project has been established to replace the contract that is to expire, ensuring there is no break in the SofS's ability to meet its statutory requirements to offer the NHS Pension scheme. 

The project will ensure the on-going provision of a pension service to the NHS and that this service is provided in the most effective and efficient way following expiry of the current contract. The specific aims of this project are to:- a) deliver a service that does not adversely affect NHS Pensions business performance and allows continuity of the 1995, 2008 and 2015 pensions service; b) adopt a fit for purpose commercial solution ensuring sufficient flexibility to accommodate transformational change; and c) improve the experience of employers and employees.

In delivering these objectives, the project will aim to:- 1) make provisions for the forthcoming expiry of the contract which covers the functions currently carried out by Equiniti Paymaster and outsource the remainder of the pensions function currently provided in-house; 2) transform the current administration service, to improve customer experience and increase efficiency; 3) ensure the revised pension administration service is agile to change; 4) ensure that the procurement delivers efficient innovative solutions for managing the cost and process of change and delivers a structure which creates coherent incentives for engagement and innovative thinking from all parties; 5) ensure that the resultant systems meet current and future needs and are value for money; 6) ensure that the service is fully and effectively aligned with relevant policies to create value in the delivery of policy as well as within operational services; and 7) support the platform upon which DH workforce can develop future Total Reward Strategies.","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Red at Q2 2014.
Although the project was progressing as fast as possible, it was unlikely to be completed within the scheduled timescale (July 2016) primarily due to business case approvals timescales required and the need to undertake a GDS recommended discovery phase activity ahead of the production of the SOC. In addition an MPA recommended  independent risk review by Mazars LLP concluded that the proposed project schedule of July 2016 posed a significant  risk of distraction to the 2015 Scheme Implementation project, a view endorsed by key stakeholders within the NHSBSA, Cabinet Office and Department of Health and direction was given to:
Â Extend the project schedule to July 2017, to mitigate any risk to the 2015 Scheme Implementation project.
Â Change the future procurement approach to a disaggregated model in line with Cabinet Office guidance to:
     o Undertake further discovery work to identify options for a short term tactical solution to deal with the expiry of current EP Payroll Services in July 2016 (EP Interim 
         Extension), ahead of the production of the Interim Business Case (IBC)
     o Undertake further discovery work to identify options for a medium term strategic solution for the full pension re-procurement, ahead of the production of the
          Programme Business Case [PBC]. 

Even when the above are complete, both streams of procurement are likely to evolve as the final level of procurement options (disaggregation) become known.  As a result the project will continue to carry a high degree of risk, reflected in the RAG status.

In the financial year 2011-12 and in 2012-13, non-pay expenditure in Trusts increased beyond the rate of general inflation.  In August 2013, DH published a report ÂBetter Procurement, Better Value, Better CareÂ, which proposed, amongst other things, that a Programme should be established to help NHS trusts deliver  1.5bn efficiency savings. The NHS Procurement Efficiency Programme received Phase 1 funding to obtain resources to mobilise the Programme in December 2013, and further interim funding arrangements to maintain Programme progress, were agreed with HMT 15th August 2014.
The Programme aims to: 
Â deliver a series of cost saving initiatives with the NHS in the short-medium term;
Â improve data, information and transparency within the NHS;
Â establish a clinically led approach to medical devices that will deliver opportunities for efficiency and establish a best practice approach to strategically managing these categories across the country; and
Â provide leadership, coordination and direction to help modernise procurement in the NHS, embedding world class procurement to increase efficiencies, capability and capacity across the NHS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
In June 2014, Lord Carter was appointed by the Secretary of State for Health as Chairman of the Procurement & Efficiency Board.

NHSmail is a fully operational service, for which demand remains strong. High user satisfaction ratings and strong support from the National Stakeholder Engagement Group and National NHSmail Forum suggests a desire to continue a secure email service for the NHS in some form. The continuation of a need, along with a number of other key infrastructure projects, was confirmed in a Department of Health announcement on 22nd September 2011.

79,Rotavirus Immunisation Programme,DoH Non Capital,Green,"Background:  Rotavirus infection is the commonest cause of gastroenteritis in children under five years of age worldwide.   Rotavirus infection in the UK is seasonal, occurring mostly in winter and early spring.   In England and Wales an estimated 130,000 episodes of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis occurred each year prior to the introduction of immunisation in children less than five years old and approximately 12,700 of these children were hospitalised.  In 2011 the Joint Committee on Immunisation and Vaccination (JCVI) advised that the Department of Health should introduce a rotavirus immunisation programme if the vaccine could be procured at a cost effective price.  Following negotiations with the manufacturer, the price paid for rotavirus vaccine resulted in the vaccination programme being cost effective. 
Objective:   The overarching objective of the rotavirus immunisation programme is the reduction of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis in England.   
Scope:  The scope of the project is limited to England and includes all the elements required to successfully deliver a rotavirus vaccination programme.  
Benefits::  the programme is delivering: 
Â rotavirus immunisation for babies added to the national immunisation schedule; 
Â a reduction of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis: and 
Â a reduction in the burden on the NHS by reducing hospital admissions and visits to GPs caused by rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis.

In 2010, JCVI advised that a universal shingles programme should be implemented for people aged 70 years to 79 years inclusive if a licensed vaccine was available at a cost effective price.  The Department of Health (DH) has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution, to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective.

These are the key areas where progress is required to enable the service to move into a live environment and the Programme Team is prioritising these actions to ensure go-live is achieved.

The MPA noted the improvement in the  quality and quantity of the resource available to the Programme. Work has also been undertaken over this period to strengthen the governance, planning and commercial aspects of the project. The Amber/Red rating was primarily due to the level of activity still required to enable the February go-live date to be achieved.

88,Automatic Enrolment Programme,DWP,Amber,"The Automatic Enrolment Programme was established to implement the GovernmentÂs workplace pension reforms. The overarching aim of the reforms is to get more people saving more for their retirement. The Programme Âwent liveÂ in October 2012, delivering:   
1) Automatic enrolment - a new duty on employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme; to increase the incentive to remain saving in a pension scheme there is a mandatory employer contribution.
2) The National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) - offers low cost pension provision to individuals on low to moderate earnings and their employers. NEST has a public service obligation to accept any employer who wishes to use it to meet their employer duty. 
3) An employer compliance regime - run by the Pension Regulator to support these measures. 

The implementation period for the Programme is 6 years: employers are being 'staged'  by size, starting with the largest, over the period October 2012 to February 2018; and contributions to pension schemes are being ÂphasedÂ in over time to provide a period of adjustment for employers and individuals, with full contributions being paid from October 2018. 
Once fully implemented the Department expects to see around 9 million people newly saving or saving more into a workplace pension, and an increase in pension saving of around  11 billion a year.
","Implementation has been successful to date. Over 5 million people automatically enrolled by December 2014 with an opt-out rate averaging less than 10 per cent. Rates of on-time compliance remain very high for those employers who have staged so far, and the Department successfully negotiated high staging volumes in Summer 2014. The Programme remains on course to complete implementation to timetable. 

The ProgrammeÂs focus now is to support the circa 1.3 million small and micro employers who begin staging from June 2015. The Department is refining the ways in which it has supported larger employers in order to meet the needs of smaller employers, and to this is:
Â testing variants of its communications channels to identify the most effective means of engagement and of securing timely compliance; 
Â helping payroll providers, advisers and intermediaries to fully support employers; and 
Â working closely with pension scheme providers and other sectors to manage the capacity required to support the delivery of the programme.

The following conditionality and compliance measures make up the package:
1. Day One Conditionality Â claimants are required to demonstrate positive job seeking behaviours from day one of their claim by ensuring they have an e-mail address, high quality CV and are registered with Universal Jobmatch.
2. Weekly Work Search Reviews Â 50 per cent of pre-Work Programme Job Seekers Allowance (JSA) claimants and Universal Credit (UC) claimants are subject to intensive work search requirements.
3. Quarterly Work Search Interviews Â pre-Work Programme claimants in receipt of JSA, and UC claimants subject to intensive work search requirements, are required to attend a 20 minute advisory interview every 13 weeks. 
4. English Language Requirements Â claimants being screened to see if they can communicate in English (very basic speaking skills) and, as necessary, mandated to an assessment and English Language training. 
5. Increasing Lone Parent Conditionality for certain groups of lone parents aged 18 and over and nominated carers.

Â The delivery of enablers which allow the Scottish Government to implement FfW in Scotland.  This will provide advice on sick absence (via on-line and telephone) for employers and employees and an assessment service for employees on sick leave for four weeks or more.
Â The abolition of the Percentage Threshold Scheme (PTS) to address perverse behaviours among employers who rely on reimbursement through the scheme rather than actively managing sickness absence. The funding from the PTS will be recycled into FfW to support a proactive approach to sickness absence management. 
Â The abolition of Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) record keeping obligations, which will lift the administration burden off employers.

The legislative changes to PTS and SSP will be implemented by the Department, with the administrative changes to HMRC operational processes being made via a separate project in HMRC.
","As result of an MPA review, the Programme has reviewed its risk management process so that implementation related risks are discussed regularly, including at the Risk Review and Programme Boards.

The Programme, with the supplier, has ensured that there are robust integrated plans in place for the delivery of FfW which is monitored through regular checkpoint meetings and reviewed at Programme Board.

The objectives of the Programme are to: 
Â Save approximately  2 billion in welfare benefit expenditure by the end of the 2014-15 financial year.
Â Contribute to the DepartmentÂs target to reduce the level of benefit expenditure overpaid to a maximum of 1.7 per cent by 2015.

110,Volume Crime,HMRC,Green,"HMRC is revising its approach to tackling fraud in the Rule Breakers customer group, increasing the number of criminal investigations and subsequent prosecutions in this group. This approach is called Volume Crime and will: deter rule breakers and potential rule breakers from fraudulent behaviour; enhance the effectiveness of civil interventions by evidencing the downsides of non-compliance; and show HMRC is relentless in pursuit of those who break the rules.  The Volume Crime project aims to significantly increase productivity and resources deployed to criminal investigation. 240 staff years will be deployed as a result of this project in Criminal Investigation and associated Risk and Intelligence Service functions, with prosecution numbers rising through the SR10 period to an additional 1,000 prosecutions delivered per year from 2014/15. The considerable increase in activity in the rule breakers segment increases the perceived risks to potential rule breakers and thus deters individuals from going down the path of tax evasion and therefore an increase in ""voluntary compliance"" due to the deterrent effect. 
The project is currently creating a research programme to measure this deterrent effect.","Benefits over the SR10 period are set to total  1,341.3m against a business case total of  1,310m.",01/04/2011,29/05/2013,Data not provided by department, 11.05m, 11.02m, 42.05m,Budget variance less than 5%,Data not provided by department,2015.0
111,Equitable Life Payment Scheme,HMT,Green,"In May 2010 the Coalition Government pledged to Âimplement the Parliamentary and Health OmbudsmanÂs recommendation to make fair and transparent payments to Equitable Life policy holders, through an independent payment scheme, for their relative loss as a consequence of regulatory failure.Â The scheme was set up rapidly, so that those who suffered losses as a result of maladministration were able to receive payments as early as possible.  As a result the GovernmentÂs stated ambition for payments to begin by the end of June 2011 was met. Payment volumes started to increase from November 2011, with the scheme moving into full operation during 2012-13. By end Q3 2014/15 (end December 2014) the Scheme had issued payment to the value of c. 998 million to c.893K (86% of total) policyholders.

In October 2013 the Chancellor announced that the Scheme would not close in 2014 but would remain open until 2015 in order to give people the maximum opportunity to claim their payments. The Treasury and the Scheme continue to work closely together to consider the most effective and efficient ways to trace and pay as many as possible of the remaining policyholders due a payment. 

The project end date shown is subject to Ministerial decision but is included for administrative purposes.
","The Green RAG status reflects the extension of the Scheme to 2015 and that the number of payment issued by the Scheme at the end of Q3 2014/15 has reached  91% for individual policyholders and 81% of group scheme policyholders and continues to slowly increase.    

 Building on the success of the advertising and further tracing work begun in Q3 2013/14, work has continued to try to find the remaining  c160,000  policyholders unpaid at the end of Q2.  Following a successful pilot of the Department for Work and PensionÂs letter forwarding service, this has been rolled out where the Scheme holds a National Insurance number, date of birth and address. At  the end of Q3 2014/15,26,000 letters sent the DWP's bulk letter forwarding service had resulted in 9,318 payments.  Success rate monitoring will continue in coming months to ensure cost effectiveness is maintained in future tracing activity.

Progress has been made in reducing the number of the remaining,  most difficult to trace, unpaid policyholders   despite these efforts. Whilst payments will continue, it is expected that, despite these continuing efforts to trace them, c12.8% of the policyholder population will not be found.

",In October 2013 the Treasury announced the ChancellorÂs decision to extend the timing of the closure of the Scheme to 2015.

Airbus Defence and Space was unable to provide an aircraft that passed the exacting acceptance criteria on schedule to meet the Programme's Capability Milestone 1 (delivery of first aircraft).  This resulted in the Transfer of Title being delayed from September 2014 to November 2014. The aircraft flew to RAF Brize Norton on 17 November 2014 and completed its first training sortie the following day. January 2015 saw Airbus Defence and Space advise OCCAR of a likely revised delivery schedule; this was published formally in February 2015.  The resultant delay to UK A400M aircraft delivery will prevent UK achieving Capability Milestone 2, UK In Service Date (ISD) (planned for March 2015) until September 2015.  The impact of these aircraft delays on subsequent UK milestones can be contained within the revised delivery plan, albeit at increased Programme risk, due to UK Programme Board action to prioritise the builds up of frontline capacity, whilst demanding more efficiency from the UK-specific A400M Defensive Aids modification programme, which is running in parallel with aircraft deliveries.

The second factor was a possible projected delay to the production of ""Block 3F"" standard software, which is critical to IOC. Since Q2 a solution to the fatigue problem has been identified and agreed, and the likely slip to the software release will not affect IOC. Progress in the Infrastructure DLOD was noted as being slow, however the SRO reported that an adequate scale of infrastructure would be available to enable IOC. Progress has now been made on gaining planning approval for the build, with Permitted Development being approved. The logistics DLOD report was occasioned by the lack of maturity of the through life sustainment plan for the Air System. Since Q2 the Lightning II Sustainment Strategy has been developed. This document lays out clearly what the sustainment strategy is through life and work is progressing through 2015 to better understand sustainment costs and to contract for the initial sustainment contract for RAF Marham. At the programme level the lack of appropriately resourced Programme Management Office was identified as being a Programme Risk, as was the lack of resource available to the DLODs themselves. This contributed to the overall Q2 Delivery Confidence. Wider Air command work is looking at both the provision of Portfolio Management Office (PMO) and resource to the DLODs. ",01/10/2001,31/03/2035,The Programme remains on track to deliver the UK IOC in December 2018 and subsequently IOC (Maritime) and FOC. The UK's first Lightning II Squadron is in place at Edwards Air Force Base in California and has taken delivery of its first aircraft. Some risk to the schedule remains as the Air System is still in the System Design and Development phase.

The new four programmes are: a.  Armoured Cavalry 2025.  Consists of the SCOUT Specialist Vehicle Equipment Project; its supporting training solution; and the other pan-Defence Line of Development projects to deliver the new Armoured Cavalry capability out to 2050; b. Armoured Infantry 2026. Consists of the Warrior Capability Sustainment Project (WCSP) Â a full turret upgrade to the ArmyÂs principal Infantry Fighting Vehicle.  The Army also has an aspiration to establish a further project within the programme to provide support to the Armoured Infantry capability through the Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicle (ABSV). This will create an upgraded and fully integrated capability out to 2040+; c. Armour Main Battle Tank 2025.

Therefore, we would expect the WLC to vary year on year to reflect changes in the market.  From 2014 to 2015, DECCÂs projections of wholesale electricity prices fell, reflecting underlying low fossil fuel prices and a subsequent reduction in DECCÂs gas and coal projections.

The military Sea King SAR service in the UK has now ended and has been replaced with new helicopters operating under the UK SAR Helicopter Programme.  This is a very significant milestone.  In addition to marking the end of military involvement in SAR in the UK, it means that all state-operated SAR helicopters in the UK are now in Coastguard livery.

Since SAR services under the UK SAR Helicopter Programme started, HM Coastguard's new helicopters have responded to over 600 requests for assistance, and saved or assisted over 500 people.

The next SAR bases to fold into the new UK SAR Helicopter Programme are at Stornoway, Lee-on-Solent and Shetland in 2017.  These bases are currently operated under legacy Coastguard helicopter contracts.  All indications are that the transition of these three remaining bases will happen on time.

40,Rail Franchising Programme,DFT,Amber,To secure the provision of passenger rail services as set out under the Railways Act 1993 (as amended) by letting Rail Franchises.,"The Rail Franchising Programme continues to deliver in line with the published schedule. Since Q2 we have made 3 franchise awards- 1 through Direct Award (West Midlands) and 2 following competition (Northern and TransPennine Express (TPE)). These awards will deliver significant benefits for passengers and higher returns to the exchequer. The Northern and TPE franchises will begin 1 April 2016 and work to mobilise them continues. This includes the formation of the joint Rail North/ DfT commercial management teams in Leeds, which will see a more localised approach to the franchises and is a step toward eventual devolution. 
The most recent issue of the franchise schedule included a retiming of the InterCity West Coast competition to ensure it is well aligned with the HS2 programme. The ICWC operator will play an important role during the construction of HS2 and in facilitating the introduction of High Speed services in 2026. This retiming will allow us to continue to engage with the market on the best options for the franchise to do this. 
We have also made changes in the procurement process to introduce a ÂPassportÂ approach to prequalification of bidders, which will make the franchise bidding process simpler and reduce the barriers to entry for new entrants to the market. This has been designed to streamline the pre-qualification process for rail franchise competitions. In particular, the Passport System is intended to reduce the time and cost involved for Applicants in providing detailed technical information for multiple rail franchise competitions. A Passport is needed for any organisation to express an interest in any future rail franchise competition.
We currently have teams working on 3 live franchise competitions at various stages of completion. West Midlands and South Western are undergoing consultation exercises and developing specifications; East Anglia is currently evaluating bids in preparation for award in the summer. The West Coast team is also in place doing preparatory work to launch the competition later this year. 
A recent PAC report into the programme confirmed the significant progress we have made in improving franchising and the benefits that it has brought to passengers since the launch of the programme in 2013. It highlighted the need to continue to ensure that the franchise market remains competitive. We are taking active steps to do this by working with OGDs and altering our policies to encourage new entrants to the market.

Â improve local connectivity and local network for all users;
Â improve safety for road users and community;
Â recognise the wider benefits of road investment and leave a positive legacy. 
","Highways EnglandÂs intention is for the A14 to be an exemplar for commercial and procurement best practice in the delivery of major projects. The strategy for delivery has centred on the Collaborative Delivery Framework (CDF) which centres upon the core belief of Highways England that significantly better value can be achieved through its supply chain with greater collaboration and engagement. The Integrated Delivery Team has been formed to enable collaboration between the various partners in the design and construction process along with Highways England. The partners are incentivised to drive down costs and to deliver early. Incentives have been set at a project wide level so that the performance of the A14 scheme, and its completion as a whole, will determine the level of incentive payments.

Successful delivery is forecast with the constant monitoring of programme, budget, spend and management of key risks to delivery. All critical delivery areas have dedicated leaders and are appropriately resourced. A key risk to achieving the start of works commitment is legal challenge to the Development Consent Order outcome.

1) Automatic enrolment - a new duty on employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme; and to increase the incentive to remain saving in a pension scheme, there is a mandatory employer contribution.
2) The National Employment Savings Trust Â which has a public service obligation to accept any employer who wishes to use it to meet their employer duty. It provides a good quality pension to individuals on low to moderate earnings. 
3) An employer compliance regime - run by the Pension Regulator to support these measures. 

The implementation approach is gradual, with employers being 'staged' by size, over the period October 2012 to February 2018; and contributions to pension schemes are being gradually increased over time to provide a period of adjustment for employers and individuals, with full contributions being paid from April 2019.
 
Once fully implemented the Department expects to see around 9 million people newly saving or saving more into a workplace pension, and an increase in pension saving of around Ĺ15 billion a year. ","Programme implementation has been successful, with over 5.8 million people automatically enrolled by over 79,000 employers, high levels of compliance amongst employers and opt-out rates amongst individuals remaining low at around 10%. 

The Programme was positively assessed by The National Audit Office in November 2015, while noting the challenge of supporting the very large volumes of small and micro employers to meet their duties from January 2016 onwards.       

In preparation for this, the Programme delivered a significant piece of work over Autumn 2015 to tailor its communications for smaller employers.

A cohort analysis of the first 8,000 people to claim Universal Credit against a comparator for Jobseekers Allowance (JSA) shows that Universal Credit claimants spend 10 hours more per week looking for work, are 8% more likely to be in work and, on average, work 12 days longer than people on JSA.

Testing of the digitally enabled service for all Universal Credit claimants continues to expand and is now in eight jobcentres  The full service began rolling out nationally from May 2016.

From May 2016, the full service will be delivered in phases initially at 5 jobcentres per month, then scaled up to 50 jobcentres a month in 2017. As each jobcentre rolls out, all new claims will be to Universal Credit, and it will no longer be possible, in that location, to make a new claim to JSA, Employment Support Allowance, Income Support, Housing Benefit or Tax Credits. By the middle of 2018 this transition will be complete and it will no longer be possible to make a claim for legacy benefits or Tax Credits anywhere in Great Britain.

The performance obligations associated with delivery of this objective are embodied within a Client Specification which forms the basis of the Site Licence Company Agreement (SLCA) and Parent Body Agreement (PBA). Following the application of competitive tension via the competition process and share transfer to a new PBO, a target cost incentivised contract arrangement is in place for delivery of the performance obligations in the contract. A contract period of 14 years is envisaged in two phases each of circa 7 years. The target cost as bid is Ĺ2.4bn for phase 1 and Ĺ1.4bn for phase 2. Currently the project is focussed on ""Consolidation"" of the successful bidders commitments into the SLC Lifetime Performance Plan (LTPP).The SLCA anticipates some change to the Target Cost during the Consolidation phase but the full extent of the change will only be known at the end of May 2016. A key enabler to achieving a lower cost for delivering the programme is the NDA's ability to put in place funding to match the programme established by the contractor in the updated LTPP. Should the updated LTPP prove to be unaffordable a further iteration may be required. ","Although the DCA was rated amber in the Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 GMPP returns, there has since been a change in circumstances. The Parent Body (CFP) started work on the Magnox estate on 1st September 2014. There then started a process to ensure that the scope of the contract assumed in the 2012 tender matched the actual status of the decommissioning to be done on each site Â a process known as Consolidation. It has become clear to the NDA through this Consolidation process that there is a significant difference between the work when the contract was tendered in 2012 and awarded in 2014, and the work that actually needs to be done. The scale of the additional work is such that the NDA Board considers that it could amount to a material change to the specification on which bidders were invited in 2012 to tender. In the light of this the NDA Board has exercised its right to terminate the contract on 2 yearsÂ notice. The contract will be terminated in September 2019, after 5 years rather than its full term of 14 years. This termination is made with the agreement of CFP. During the period to September 2019, the NDA will establish arrangements for a replacement contracting structure to be put in place when the current contract ends.

Although the deadline for making 95.238% of payments funded by the EU to BPS customers for the 2015 scheme year was extended by the European Commission, this target was actually achieved by the original deadline of 30th June 2016.  At the end of Q2, full payment had been made to 99.5% of BPS2015 customers totalling Ĺ1.38bn, and by the extended deadline of 15th October, only a small number were still to be paid,  which were largely probate cases, fraud cases, and those with missing bank account details.
Processing of BPS 2016 claims was well under way at the end of Q2 and a public commitment to pay 90% of claims by the end of December 2016 was met, and the further commitment to pay 93% of claims by the end of March 2017 was exceeded.

68,Automatic Enrolment Programme ,DWP,Amber,"The Automatic Enrolment Programme was established to implement the GovernmentÂs workplace pension reforms. The overarching aim of the reforms is to get more people saving more for their retirement. The Programme went live in October 2012, delivering:   
1) Automatic enrolment - a new duty on employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme; and to increase the incentive to remain saving in a pension scheme, there is a mandatory employer contribution.
2) The National Employment Savings Trust Â which has a public service obligation to accept any employer who wishes to use it to meet their employer duty. It provides a good quality pension to individuals on low to moderate earnings. 
3) An employer compliance regime - run by the Pension Regulator to support these measures. 

The implementation approach is gradual, with employers being 'staged' by size, over the period October 2012 to February 2018; and contributions to pension schemes are being gradually increased over time to provide a period of adjustment for employers and individuals, with full contributions being paid from April 2019. Once fully implemented the Department expects to see around 10 million people newly saving or saving more into a workplace pension, and an increase in pension saving of around Ĺ17 billion a year.
","Programme implementation has been successful, with people automatically enrolled,  high levels of compliance amongst employers and opt-out rates amongst individuals remaining low at around 9%.
 
The Programme is now focusing upon supporting individuals and employers as we implement increases in pension contributions, and to support the large numbers of small and micros employers who will undertake their duties through 2017 and beyond. There remains a level of uncertainty around how employers and individuals will behave.

Â A detailed plan, covering for example, legal, IT, commercial, HR and core business readiness requirements, including all dependencies, is produced and that the end to end programme critical path is created using this level of detail. On-going
Â Individual ""customer user briefs"" (some of which already exist) are defined for each building.  These should capture the individual action for each building, in line with customer needs.  The aggregation of these should be understood and linked to the overall plan. Cleared
Â The formal sign-off of lease agreements needs to be completed at the optimum time and recognising value for money objectives.  The PLP needs to ensure that, using appropriate management information, explicit decisions are made on the basis of trade-offs between the time available and the achievement of value for money. On-going
Â The PLP needs to de-risk the delivery of the procurement of the Estates Target Operating Model (ETOM).  It should produce both a detailed procurement plan and TT exit strategy and develop a critical path.   Working with partners, the PLP needs to identify and remove current significant barriers to progress by securing early additional resources and simplifying the procurement process. The PLP should ensure that appropriate contingencies are introduced and managed. On-going

Throughout, the Programme has remained focussed on delivering the outcomes designed to ensure the Department manages fraud, error and debt in a systematic way Â from initial referral, through risk management, to interventions and debt recovery Â supported by appropriate campaigns and penalties. 
The Programme is part of a wider Fraud, Error and Debt Strategy which encompasses components of other programmes such as Universal Credit (UC). 

The key objectives are: 
Â to continue to optimise the use of HMRCÂs earnings, employment and pensions data for income-related benefits, sharing details with the wider Department where there is a need to use this data, including working with local authorities on Housing Benefit  
Â to work with DWP Fraud and Error Service to transform the management of fraud, error and debt referrals, improving business processes and provide members of the public with a userÂfriendly and confidential service to report benefit fraud online;
Â to have a debt and deduction recovery solution in place enabling existing cases of DWP, HMRC, Social Fund and local authority debt and other additional third party deductions to be recovered on migration to Universal Credit (UC);

NEM was not a savings exercise, rather its objective was to modernise the offer (supporting lifestyle choice and domestic stability) while also fixing elements of policy that were proving a known barrier to retention. It has delivered a suite of projects (initiated in SDSR10) that has delivered positive changes to the terms and conditions of service for Armed Forces personnel.
Now in the final stages of delivery, having implemented the majority of its components, the programme is expected to close by the end of 2017, with transition continuing to the nominal end-of-life of the programme in 2020 and beyond.

It will create reception prisons which will service the courts and manage those on remand. The training estate for sentenced prisoners will be improved and expanded so that the supply of places meets demand. For prisoners nearing the end of their sentence or on short custodial sentences there will be enhanced resettlement prisons. PETP will improve how female offenders are managed through the creation of small community prisons. These changes will be delivered through the reconfiguration of the existing custodial estate and the construction of new prisons and smaller houseblock units within existing prisons. In the interest of transparency, the programme's capital value will likely include a steel element whose value will be in excess of Ĺ10m.","The Programme is complex with a relatively large number of interlinked projects and workstreams. The operating environment within which the programme is being delivered is also undergoing significant change. The programme has put in place appropriate mitigations, including use of Optimism Bias, resulting in an overall Amber score.

Extensive engagement with stakeholders and robust modelling is being used to develop a preferred option for the Outline Business Case to maximise the programme's contribution to rehabilitating offenders, reducing long term costs and releasing land for housing.

139,MoJ Shared Services Evolve (SS Evolve) Programme ,MoJ,Amber/Red,The MoJ Shared Services ProgrammeÂs aim is to deliver transformation in the approach to the provision of back office services in MoJ.,"At quarter 2, the programme was working to a plan, baselined June 2016, which the MoJ and Crown Oversight Function acknowledged was a high risk plan, for November delivery. Risk in key areas to the programme were high: data, payroll, IT Enablement and some SOP design elements. These were escalated to the Evolve Programme Board to progress mitigating actions.  This was reflected in the Amber/Red delivery confidence assessment.

A decision was later taken that the portal would be upgraded and operating before the end of the calendar year and as a consequence, MoJ would go-live on the single operating platform in January 2017. 

The programme has successfully taken remedial action against the delivery confidence rating and delivered successfully on 30 January 2017.

The project originally started with a retender of 3 contracts for Rainsbrook, Medway and Hassockfield STCs).  During the course of the project however, this was reduced to 1 contract due to a fall in demand resulting in Hassockfield STC being decommissioned and decisions made by the Secretary of State resulting in the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) being asked to take over the running of Medway STC from 1 July 2016.  The remaining STC at Rainsbrook is a site of about 80 places, which accommodates 12-17 year old boys, and girls (including mothers with babies) remanded or sentenced to custody who, because of their complex needs and risks to self and others, are unsuitable for placement in other parts of the youth secure estate. The project is at the stage of transformation of a new contract with a new provider. ","Quarter 2 was assessed as Amber/Red as there were significant risks to transformation delivery caused by operational performance issues and the contractors reduced workforce. This required MTCnovo to reprioritise some of its transformation resource to deliver immediate operational improvements. 

The contractor successfully mobilised and new service commenced at the STC on 5 May 2016.  However they inherited a depleted staff group and this affected the contractor's plans for operation and transformation of the site. In response, the contractor introduced a new recruitment and retention strategy.  Further plans for improving the site have been agreed together with an extension to the transformation period. Some areas of transformation have now been delivered including changes to education, case management and other activities for young people, new staffing structures and rotas and building improvements. Other key areas of transformation, including the introduction of new operating procedures are expected to be complete by May 2017.
