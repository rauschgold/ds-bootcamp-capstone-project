",Ł1.80,Ł1.70,-6%,"Ł49,891.20",Internal project resource required for 2017-18 has been marginally less than forcast at the start of the year.,"The Whole Life Costs (WLC) for this project are determined by the difference between the Strike Price for Hinkley Point C and the long-term Wholesale Electricity Price forecasts, which are influenced by market prices for fossil fuels.  Therefore, we would expect the WLC to vary year on year to reflect changes in the market.   
Wholesale prices are volatile and sensitive to a number of uncertain factors including, for example, future global gas price trends, carbon prices, coal prices, the level of intermittent generators in the system and demand trends.  Whereas the strike price agreed for Hinkley Point C is fixed and has been set following extensive negotiations with EDF and with advice from independent expert advisors.  Hinkley Point C alone will generate 7% of reliable low carbon electricity for the UK; enough to power 6 million homes for 65 years."
6,Geological Disposal Facility Programme (GDF),BEIS,Amber,"The primary objective of the programme is to site and construct a permanent geological disposal facility (GDF) as the safe, secure and environmentally responsible solution to the long-term management of higher-activity radioactive waste in the UK, excluding Scotland.   The programme also supports the delivery of the UK's nuclear new build programme because before development consents for new nuclear power stations are granted, the Government needs to be satisfied that effective arrangements exist or will exist to manage and dispose of the wastes they will produce. The programme complies with all public procurement policy obligations including the guidance in Procurement Policy Note 16/15. The developer will be able to provide data once we are in the implementation phase of the programme ie we have a designated site and a site specific rather than a generic design.

7,Heat Networks Investment Project,BEIS,Exempt under Section 43 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (Commercial Interests),The Heat Network Investment Project (HNIP) consists of project pipeline development and time-limited Ł320 million capital support to build heat networks in England and Wales.  ,"HNIP has made full use of both internal and external (IPA) reviews to ensure that the project was on track prior to the launch of pilot. 
HNIP is also undertaking lessons learned reviews as well as comissioning an evaluation of the project so that HNIP can learn from the pilot phase and refine the project ahead of Main Scheme launch.

Since the the October GMPP return the project has made considerable progress and has successfully launched and delivered the pilot phase, on schedule.",25/11/2015,31/03/2021,"The HNIP is being developed in 2 stages, Pilot Phase and Main Scheme

The Pilot Phase consists of an initial funding round, delivered through Salix/BEIS and utilising funding allocated to 2016/17 as well as some from 2017/18, to test process and project design. This will conclude on 31st March 2017 

The Main Scheme will incorporate learning from the Pilot Phase and will cover the remaining period of the project which runs to 2021. A delivery body for the Main Scheme will be procured through open competition. The aim of the project is to launch the Main Scheme in 2017, but final timings regarding this will be confirmed later in the year.

",Ł36.60,Ł36.60,0%,Ł352.70,Budget variance less than 5%.,"As part of the 2015 Spending Review agreement, Ł320m of capital funding was allocated to BEIS to support investment in heat network projects.

Of this money Ł27m has been allotted to the financial year 2016/2017 with the rest profiled each year to 2020/2021. 

The cost-benefit analysis undertaken for the HNIP Pilot Outline Business Case (in line with Q2) assesses the social NPV for the scheme as a whole at Ł365m, with 6.5Mt of total carbon savings over the appraisal period. This will be finalised as part of the work on the OBC for the Main Scheme in 2017.

8,Magnox & RSRL PBO Competition,BEIS,Amber,"The objective of the procurement (the Magnox Competition) is the delivery of a series of outputs largely based on the extant baselines of Magnox and RSRL, currently defined as outcomes of the Magnox Optimised Decommissioning Plan (MODP) and Optimised RSRL Baseline (HOP and WOP) at 10% lower cost. The performance obligations associated with delivery of this objective are embodied within a Client Specification which forms the basis of the Site Licence Company Agreement (SLCA) and Parent Body Agreement (PBA). Following the application of competitive tension via the competition process and share transfer to a new PBO, a target cost incentivised contract arrangement is in place for delivery of the performance obligations in the contract. A contract period of 14 years is envisaged in two phases each of circa 7 years. The target cost as bid is Ł2.4bn for phase 1 and Ł1.4bn for phase 2. Currently the project is focussed on ""Consolidation"" of the successful bidders commitments into the SLC Lifetime Performance Plan (LTPP).The SLCA anticipates some change to the Target Cost during the Consolidation phase but the full extent of the change will only be known at the end of May 2016. A key enabler to achieving a lower cost for delivering the programme is the NDA's ability to put in place funding to match the programme established by the contractor in the updated LTPP. Should the updated LTPP prove to be unaffordable a further iteration may be required. ","Although the DCA was rated amber in the Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 GMPP returns, there has since been a change in circumstances. The Parent Body (CFP) started work on the Magnox estate on 1st September 2014. There then started a process to ensure that the scope of the contract assumed in the 2012 tender matched the actual status of the decommissioning to be done on each site  a process known as Consolidation. It has become clear to the NDA through this Consolidation process that there is a significant difference between the work when the contract was tendered in 2012 and awarded in 2014, and the work that actually needs to be done. The scale of the additional work is such that the NDA Board considers that it could amount to a material change to the specification on which bidders were invited in 2012 to tender. In the light of this the NDA Board has exercised its right to terminate the contract on 2 years notice. The contract will be terminated in September 2019, after 5 years rather than its full term of 14 years. This termination is made with the agreement of CFP. During the period to September 2019, the NDA will establish arrangements for a replacement contracting structure to be put in place when the current contract ends. 
",03/04/2012,31/08/2015,"With the announcement on the 27th March 2017 that the Magnox Contract has been terminated by mutual consent, the NDA will now embark on a process to establish replacement arrangements. At the same time a timetable and schedule of activities for delivering this alternative will be prepared and the required assurance framework will be established to run alongside",Ł692.00,Ł434.00,-37%,"Ł3,860.00","The 2016/17 variance between the baseline and the forecast reflects a pre-consolidation position for the Target Cost. At the time of the termination announcement, the Consolidation process remains incomplete, and as a result a variance commentary is not meaningful. On completion of Consolidation an updated variance commentary will be provided.  ",The comment above relating to the 2016/17 variance is also applicable to the Whole Life Cost.

The overall approach to Transformation is making good progress towards delivering real impact in FY 17/18, and leading further work in defining the critical activities and capabilities required in the longer term. 
Driven by the need to implement a better way to deliver three specific time critical projects, a proposed approach for improving project delivery at Sellafield was brought forwards for an approval in advance of the wider transformation proposition.  Sellafield, supported by NDA, continue to work on the transformation proposition and vision, and to work with senior government officials, to secure the guiding coalition and the delivery controls and reporting required for successful delivery.

10,Smart Meters Implementation Programme,BEIS,Amber,"The Government's vision is for every home in Great Britain to have smart electricity and gas meters by 2020. Smart Meters will give consumers up-to-date information about how much gas and/or electricity they have used in pounds and pence, as well as units of energy.  Smart meters will have benefits for consumers, suppliers and energy networks. Consumers will have near real-time information about their energy use, enabling them to monitor and manage their energy consumption, save money and reduce carbon emissions.  Switching between suppliers will also be made simpler and faster. Energy suppliers will have access to accurate data for billing and will be able to offer a wider range of services and tariffs.  Energy networks will have better information to manage and plan current activities and support the move towards the development of a smart grid. ","An IPA Gate 0 Review in March 2016 assessed the Programme as Amber.

","The Amber rating at 30th September 2016 reflected good progress towards meeting Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) targets and in processing Countryside Stewardship (CS) applications, but also took into account the requirement for additional system releases to be made later in the year and the risk in delivering these.  Details of delivery to date are:
Although the deadline for making 95.238% of payments funded by the EU to BPS customers for the 2015 scheme year was extended by the European Commission, this target was actually achieved by the original deadline of 30th June 2016.  At the end of Q2, full payment had been made to 99.5% of BPS2015 customers totalling Ł1.38bn, and by the extended deadline of 15th October, only a small number were still to be paid,  which were largely probate cases, fraud cases, and those with missing bank account details.
Processing of BPS 2016 claims was well under way at the end of Q2 and a public commitment to pay 90% of claims by the end of December 2016 was met, and the further commitment to pay 93% of claims by the end of March 2017 was exceeded.  
The application window for 2017 CS Mid-Tier agreements closed on 30th September, at which point 3770 applications had been received, in addition to 954 applications for Higher Tier agreements.

The schools will be handed over by the end of 2021.To ensure value for money for the public sector, schools in both phases of the programme are grouped together to make projects (or batches) that will be commercially attractive and drive strong competition. This grouping of projects also allows us to take advantage of economies in procurement in terms of both time and cost.   The programme has 143 schools worth over Ł10m of which 75 have their design and build contracts awarded.The future pipeline of projects determining requirements on steel sourcing have been signalled to the market pre-procurement.

HS2 is in excellent shape and substantial progress has been made in all areas of the programme this year.
 
The Hybrid Bill for Phase 1 received Royal Assent in February 2017, giving us powers to acquire land and construct the railway.  Phase 1 has now moved into its delivery phase; enabling works have commenced, we are preparing to let the main civil works contracts for the construction of the railway and we have issued the first notices under the compulsory purchase powers to acquire the land.  Following engagement with train manufacturers, we are also readying ourselves to launch the procurement for the rolling stock for the scheme.  We have also issued a Prior Information Notice for a Master Development Partner to work with us on regeneration above and around Euston Station.
 
Phase 2 has also progressed well, we are readying ourselves to deposit a hybrid Bill for Phase 2a prior to summer recess.   The Secretary of State announced the route for Phase 2b and we have consulted on property compensation schemes.",28/02/2011,31/12/2033,"The project continues to make excellent progress against a challenging schedule.  

Phase 1:

Royal Assent has been given to the Hybrid Bill which has given us powers to acquire land and construct the railway.  HS2 Ltd has been appointed nominated undertaker for the scheme. We have started to acquire land to commence construction, with around 500 notices for access being issued in March 2017 to carry out surveys, together with up to 50 temporary possession notices. The first compulsory purchase order notices were served in April.

Contracts have been let to undertake essential enabling works along the route, and we have started these works. The procurement process for main works contractors for the scheme has commenced and tender bids are being evaluated.  Award of contracts is expected in summer 2017, following completion of the procurement process.

We are also preparing to start the procurement of a Master Development Partner to create a scheme for the development of the wider Euston station area.

39,InterCity Express Programme (IEP),DfT,Amber,Intercity Express Programme (IEP) will renew the UK's high speed train fleet on the Great Western and East Coast. Through franchise competitions IEP is a key means to deliver the passenger benefits from the associated upgrades including more capacity improved reliability reduced journey times and better environmental performance. The order supports a new manufacturing facility at Newton Aycliffe where a new highly skilled engineering workforce will process the carriage body shells that Hitachi produce in Japan and build and fit out the trains ready for passenger service. This has created over 900 new jobs and supports thousands more in the UK supply chain as over 70% of parts for the trains are from UK sources. IEP serves London to Bristol Cardiff Swansea Cheltenham & Worcester and London to Leeds Edinburgh & Aberdeen offering through-trains from non-electrified lines without the need to change or attach a locomotive.,"Given the revised electrification dates published in the Hendy Review, the Department has decided to ensure passengers benefit from the new trains as soon as possible and funded conversion of all GWR IEPs to bi-mode. The trains are scheduled to enter passenger service from Autumn 2017.  Although there were delays to the completion of the test site, train testing is progressing but requires continued attention to ensure successful delivery, hence the Amber rating.

A Taskforce meets at least weekly and a Delivery Board weekly to track progress of activities reuqired to achieve October 2017. ",01/06/2005,06/02/2020,"IEP is operating to a compressed schedule to deliver trains to GWR by October 17 following delays to completion of the test site and discovery of electrical interference issues.

This mitigates the programme delivery and benefits realisation impacts of the delayed Network Rail electrification works which are being delivered as part of the Great Western route modernisation.","Following the approved cost increase the budgeted WLC for IEP is Ł6.5bn. 
This comprises Ł480m for CP5 Network Rail infrastructure works and Ł6.02bn in respect of the new rolling stock and depots. 

The increase is attributed to payments for works required to mitigate the testing delays and the bi-mode variation.

Further cost increases as a result of work on the unmuzzling variation and wider commercial contract negotiations.  "

This is an ongoing programme of replacement and renewal of franchises, and the continual performance management of contracts, once signed.","Since Q2 the IPA have  recognised the external challenges that the Programme faces, many of which are out of its control (including adverse developments in national PPM trends, market interest in bidding declines and the downward shift in revenue growth, counter to the trend over the last two decades). Despite the rating Passenger Services was praised for the significant progress that has been made over a period in the face of great scrutiny and a very significant workload.  There are 11 recommendations that will now be taken forward including 2 critical recommendations around contingency planning and recruitment. Initial plans to respond to the recommendations are now being developed with the intention of holding an Assurance of Action Plan in summer 2017.

All recommendations from the previous Gateway 0 in October 2014 were responded to and implemented in 2015. This includes the appointment of Directors accountable to the SRO, improvements to our Risk Process and developing our Programme Outcomes.

The Rail Franchising Programme continues to deliver in line with the published schedule. Since Q2 we have made 1 franchise award following competition (East Anglia). This award will deliver significant benefits for passengers and higher returns to the exchequer. The East Anglia franchise was awarded in June, mobilised and begun in Oct 16. Key benefits of the new franchise include:
 Ł1.4 billion investment to local rail services
 1,043 new, state of the art carriages between January 2019 and September 2020 to support the faster timetable, with a full programme of refurbishment for the current fleet in the meantime
 at least 4 90-minute services (2 in each direction) between London and Norwich each weekday and 2 60-minute services per day between London and Ipswich
 free Wi-Fi for all passengers on trains and at stations
 automatic delay repay for season and advance purchase tickets
 tough new targets for operational performance levels at 93% - up from 89.7% currently
 a host of new ticketing initiatives, starting in October 2017, including new offers for part time users and those who dont travel every day
We have developed commercial plans to make better use of the information we receive from a variety of sources so that we can:
 Better anticipate and plan for changes in market conditions and more robustly plan for future franchise specifications 
 Be more informed and provide a better response to the annual business plans we receive from TOCS
The Commercial Plans will provide
 Strategic objectives planned for each franchise post-contract award, which will provide the basis for in-life management teams performance objectives;
 An overview and most importantly a critical analysis of core MI;
 Planned policy activities requiring in-life Changes;
 A focus for value add contract management activities, e.g. assessing benefits realisation following delivery of committed obligations; and

The retiming of the InterCity West Coast competition (ICWC) (now the West Coast Partnership (WCP)), which will incorporate the procurement of a shadow operator for HS2 into the franchise competition and was announced in Nov 16. This retiming will allow us to continue to engage with the market on the best options for the franchise to do this. A West Coast Continuation project is now underway to ensure there is no gap in service between the ICWC expiry date (Apr 18) and the start of the new WCP franchise (Apr 19)

  Costs remain contained within the capital budget as approved in July 2015,
  All recommendations from the November 2015 IPA Project Assessment Review have been acted upon/are being addressed by the PBT Programme.
NHS England will work closely with UCLH to re-plan the transition to the national service, and to confirm any financial impacts.

","Whole life costs - are composed of capital account (CDEL) and revenue account (RDEL) spend (at Nominal Pricing).  The overall spend profile of the PBT Programme remains within Budgeted Whole Life Costs.  The financial profile shows a large CDEL spend [Ł215 m (net of VAT and a Charitable contribution ~Ł20 m)] in the years to 2019/20 to build and equip the facilities, along with a relatively small RDEL spend to 2018/19 - covering interest, staff not involved in the development of the centres and training of clinical and technical staff prior to service commencement. From the date of service commencement (i.e. from The Christie first patient treatment date in August 2018), RDEL costs will start to ramp up to an annual cost of around Ł50m per annum (i.e. once UCLH is providing services).

To address these concerns in Q2 2016 the programme was in the process of developing and agreeing a multi-strand approach to implementation, enhancement and rollout of the e-Referral Service including:
1) Contractual Leverage: NHS England driven three part enhancements to standard contracts over a three year period to leverage use. a)  The Standard Contract for 2018/19 requires the full use of the NHS e-Referral Service for all consultant led first outpatient appointments by the end of September 2018. b) The Quality Premium for 2016/17 includes a payment to Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) for achieving 80% of first outpatient appointments via NHS e-Referral Service, or a 20% point uplift in year. c) The NHS e-Referral Service and Advice and Guidance CQUINs offer incentives to use the NHS e-Referral Service to secure improvements in the quality of services and better outcomes for patients. 
2) Research: NHS D undertook an intensive research project to investigate non-use of the system and feed into a revised strategic roadmap to ensure enhancements to the service aligned with user needs.
3) System Enhancements: A clear view of the enhancements and functional changes planned to March 2018 and required to support rollout to be developed and agreed through ERAB (Electronic Referral Advisory Board)  and published to stakeholder groups providing the NHS with a clear view of the strategic direction and capability of the service.
4) Revised Implementation strategy: A revised strategy, with collaborative effort from NHS England regional teams and NHS Digital Implementation and Business Change function is proposed and in the process of agreement.
This is not straightforward given the interplay between imminent controls (November 2016), the business case through to March 2018 and the definition of digital referrals.

A continuation FBC covering this period is going through the approval process.
The underspend in revenue and capital Pre 2016/17 reflects the delay in go live for the eRS service and the agreement of the Infrastructure as a Service FBC at a lower rate than budgeted.  ","At Q2 2016/17 the forecast expenditure to 2017/8 remains Ł22m below baseline (at Ł109m compared to OBC figure of Ł131m).

The requirement for steel for this programme has not yet been decided.  Following the Spending Review, an options analysis is being conducted to accomodate all the staff now in scope at various levels of risk.

Resources - working closely with other parts of PHE to maximise sharing of resources, use of backfill policy to facilitate resource release, 2. Scope - timelines are being revised to allow for re-design to accommodate additional staff. Other changes will be managed by the request for change process and this will be carefully monitored as there is the potential for change driven by other PHE programmes.  The implications of the security requirements and the need for proportionality will become clearer through discussion with DH and advisory bodies such as CPNI. Deployment of the iHub continues however the Programme continues to await a date for when PHE ICT will run a full 'failover' testing which validates the system's ability to move operations to back-up systems during any server failure. The issue is being monitored by the Programme Director.  The change of scope to accomodate 600 extra staff resulted in a redesign requirement causing slippage to the RIBA stage 2 schedule and the procurement schedule.

68,Automatic Enrolment Programme ,DWP,Amber,"The Automatic Enrolment Programme was established to implement the Governments workplace pension reforms. The overarching aim of the reforms is to get more people saving more for their retirement. The Programme went live in October 2012, delivering:   
1) Automatic enrolment - a new duty on employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme; and to increase the incentive to remain saving in a pension scheme, there is a mandatory employer contribution.
2) The National Employment Savings Trust  which has a public service obligation to accept any employer who wishes to use it to meet their employer duty. It provides a good quality pension to individuals on low to moderate earnings. 
3) An employer compliance regime - run by the Pension Regulator to support these measures. 

The implementation approach is gradual, with employers being 'staged' by size, over the period October 2012 to February 2018; and contributions to pension schemes are being gradually increased over time to provide a period of adjustment for employers and individuals, with full contributions being paid from April 2019. Once fully implemented the Department expects to see around 10 million people newly saving or saving more into a workplace pension, and an increase in pension saving of around Ł17 billion a year.
","Programme implementation has been successful, with people automatically enrolled,  high levels of compliance amongst employers and opt-out rates amongst individuals remaining low at around 9%.
 
The Programme is now focusing upon supporting individuals and employers as we implement increases in pension contributions, and to support the large numbers of small and micros employers who will undertake their duties through 2017 and beyond. There remains a level of uncertainty around how employers and individuals will behave.
 
Balancing Programme successes to date against these remaining challenges, the Programme Board has rated the Programme as Amber.  ",01/05/2007,30/11/2018,The Programme went live on time. The implementation approach has been designed to accommodate the significant increase in volumes over the 2015-2018 period.

The 4 IPA recommendations from the October 2016 review are being actively managed, with action managers appointed for each one.  The recommendations were:

 A detailed plan, covering for example, legal, IT, commercial, HR and core business readiness requirements, including all dependencies, is produced and that the end to end programme critical path is created using this level of detail. On-going
 Individual ""customer user briefs"" (some of which already exist) are defined for each building.  These should capture the individual action for each building, in line with customer needs.  The aggregation of these should be understood and linked to the overall plan. Cleared
 The formal sign-off of lease agreements needs to be completed at the optimum time and recognising value for money objectives.  The PLP needs to ensure that, using appropriate management information, explicit decisions are made on the basis of trade-offs between the time available and the achievement of value for money. On-going
 The PLP needs to de-risk the delivery of the procurement of the Estates Target Operating Model (ETOM).  It should produce both a detailed procurement plan and TT exit strategy and develop a critical path.   Working with partners, the PLP needs to identify and remove current significant barriers to progress by securing early additional resources and simplifying the procurement process. The PLP should ensure that appropriate contingencies are introduced and managed. On-going

There is no overall change in whole life costs for the programme as the same activity must be performed (at same cost) but in a shorter/diminishing timescale.
70,"Fraud, Error and Debt Programme",DWP,Amber/Green,"The Fraud, Error and Debt Programme (FEDP) has evolved, growing into a package of both long term transformational projects and short term initiatives, at various stages of development and delivery. Operating like a portfolio, projects roll on and off the programme over its lifetime, with many earlier projects now delivered and operational. 

Throughout, the Programme has remained focussed on delivering the outcomes designed to ensure the Department manages fraud, error and debt in a systematic way  from initial referral, through risk management, to interventions and debt recovery  supported by appropriate campaigns and penalties. 
The Programme is part of a wider Fraud, Error and Debt Strategy which encompasses components of other programmes such as Universal Credit (UC). 

The key objectives are: 
 to continue to optimise the use of HMRCs earnings, employment and pensions data for income-related benefits, sharing details with the wider Department where there is a need to use this data, including working with local authorities on Housing Benefit  
 to work with DWP Fraud and Error Service to transform the management of fraud, error and debt referrals, improving business processes and provide members of the public with a userfriendly and confidential service to report benefit fraud online;
 to have a debt and deduction recovery solution in place enabling existing cases of DWP, HMRC, Social Fund and local authority debt and other additional third party deductions to be recovered on migration to Universal Credit (UC); 
 to work with Debt Management (DM) to deliver a transformational, multi-channel DWP DM service, that encourages customers to selfserve in the repayment of their debt; and
 to continue to support Local Authorities to reduce fraud and error by undertaking additional activity to detect and correct Housing Benefit fraud and error.","An IPA review in February 2016 recognised the Programme had a good track record of delivering complex projects and initiatives. Following the review the Programme: 
 continues to ensure its long term plan is aligned to the Fraud, Error and Debt strategy, focussing on ensuring delivery of savings from welfare reform and targeting the major known areas of loss;
 ensures alignment between FED Programme initiatives and the UC Programme, via formal representation and governance routes. 
",02/04/2012,31/03/2017,"At Quarter 2 2016-17 the Programme:

 successfully delivered further major components of the debt and deduction recovery solution (Social Fund and Local Authority elements delivered August 2016) via a series of interfaces, enabling existing cases of DWP, Social Fund and local authority debt to be recovered on migration to Universal Credit (UC); 

 Is investigating options to exploit the Wider Use of RTI service. Following the early success and potential to reduce fraud and error, the project continues with Pension Centre roll-out and is preparing to test the service with a few Local Authorities. 

 Is developing a solution focusing on the transformation of the management of fraud and error solutions by testing a preferred product.

 People with a disability, referred to the programme by their Work Coach at the most appropriate time on a targeted, voluntary basis subject to them meeting specific criteria.  It is envisaged that most referrals will be between three and twelve months into their benefit claim, where such a claim exists. The essential criteria are that the individual has volunteered to participate in the programme, they have signed up to the objective of finding work in the next 12 months and will benefit from the increased and more intensive personalised and integrated support that the WHP will provide; 
 Claimants who are in the intensive work search regime or claiming Jobseekers Allowance, will be mandated to WHP upon reaching 24 months of their claim if they meet the specified referral criteria.

LE TacCIS is a transformational change programme that will information enable the Land Environment in the full conduct of operations.  

It is initially based on an opening up of the communications architecture across a number of currently stove-piped systems such that, in the future, upgrades can be conducted on a spiral basis across system boundaries whilst being more reactive to changes in requirements and at lower cost.  This will allow UK MOD to retain its technological advantage.

However, a decision was made in early October between John Manzoni, Chief Executive of the Civil Service, Ministry of Justice and Department for Work & Pensions Permanent Secretaries to delay a planned upgrade to the RM portal until November 2016. This enabled the upgrade to the RM portal to take place with the least disruption across all framework customers.  This decision impacted on the planned date for Ministry of Justice to on-board to the SOP platform, moving it to January 2017.

140,Secure Training centre (STC) Retendering Project,MoJ,Amber/Red,"The project is retendering and mobilising a Secure Training Centre (STC) contract.  The project originally started with a retender of 3 contracts for Rainsbrook, Medway and Hassockfield STCs).  During the course of the project however, this was reduced to 1 contract due to a fall in demand resulting in Hassockfield STC being decommissioned and decisions made by the Secretary of State resulting in the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) being asked to take over the running of Medway STC from 1 July 2016.  The remaining STC at Rainsbrook is a site of about 80 places, which accommodates 12-17 year old boys, and girls (including mothers with babies) remanded or sentenced to custody who, because of their complex needs and risks to self and others, are unsuitable for placement in other parts of the youth secure estate. The project is at the stage of transformation of a new contract with a new provider. ","Quarter 2 was assessed as Amber/Red as there were significant risks to transformation delivery caused by operational performance issues and the contractors reduced workforce. This required MTCnovo to reprioritise some of its transformation resource to deliver immediate operational improvements. 

The contractor successfully mobilised and new service commenced at the STC on 5 May 2016.  However they inherited a depleted staff group and this affected the contractor's plans for operation and transformation of the site. In response, the contractor introduced a new recruitment and retention strategy.  Further plans for improving the site have been agreed together with an extension to the transformation period. Some areas of transformation have now been delivered including changes to education, case management and other activities for young people, new staffing structures and rotas and building improvements. Other key areas of transformation, including the introduction of new operating procedures are expected to be complete by May 2017. Some areas of work, including roll out of IT for use by young people may continue after this period. ",05/11/2012,01/05/2017,The new service at Rainsbrook STC commenced on time on 5 May 2016.  The period in which the contractor will implement most of their plans for transforming the operation of the site was increased from 6 months to a year. As a result project closure is now expected to take place during the summer of  2017.  This does not affect the overall contract period.,Ł10.83,Ł10.83,0%,Ł86.98,Budget variance less than 5%,"The whole life cost of the project reflects the agreed new contract and utilities costs over 7 years.
