"Description / Aims 
(From GMPP data)","A shared service solution for the BIS network will: deliver a structural reduction in the cost base; provide simpler, transparent and more integrated processes across the BIS family of organisations; and secure continuous cost and process improvement through innovation and the application of a professional business focus.
It can underpin strategic management of BIS and its partners with timely, accurate, valued and well-aligned financial management information.","In September 2012 the Government announced the creation of a business bank to address long-standing structural gaps in the supply of finance to SMEs and mid-sized corporates. The bank, which has been allocated £1bn of Government funding, will be tasked with supporting the development of diverse finance markets for business, tackling market failures in the provision of finance, and ensuring that businesses are aware of and can access the support provided by Government.
The new institution will operate through the wholesale markets in order to unlock institutional investment to benefit small to medium sized businesses; it will not have any retail presence. Rather, it will facilitate the provision of loans, including long-term patient capital, to UK firms through banks and other financial institutions. The 'Business Bank' will be the single public identity and centre of expertise in government on all commercially-minded finance schemes for small and mid-sized businesses. These services will be managed as a single portfolio with operational and budget flexibility.
The bank will commercially-focused, employing finance, investment, business and public sector professionals to pool the expertise of the relevant markets and efficiently build up and manage the bank's operations. It will be able to determine its own priorities, subject to high level objectives, budgets and operating principles set by Ministers. The 'Business Bank' will not seek to replace or compete with existing and future finance providers, but rather to ensure that there is a greater range of providers and products on offer to businesses.","To Introduce loans for those aged 24 or over, undertaking provision at Level 3 and above from 2013/2014. The project will allow savings to be realised through the conversion of grant to loan funding while still allowing access to advanced and higher level provision . Introduction of loans should put greater power into the hands of learners, creating a more responsive system. System should be simple and non-bureaucratic , representing good value for money and making use of Higher Education (HE) infrastructure to minimise disruption and facilitate progression.                                                                                                                                                                                                    ","HM Government is carrying out a programme of asset sales with the purpose of reducing Public Sector Net Debt (“PSND”). The Government has announced intentions to sell the pre-Browne Income Contingent Repayment (ICR) student loan book to contribute to this objective and to realise value to the taxpayer.  This loan book will be sold in a series of tranches over a number of years.  The first tranche of loans is expected to be sold by 2015-16.  As is normal with transactions of this type, there will be a value for money assessment made before each sale. Each sale is required to meet the value for money assessment as well as other key project objectives to be considered a success.  Failure to meet objectives will result in a decision not to sell.","The Government has adopted a policy of asset disposal where there is no longer a good case in public policy terms for continued public ownership.  On that basis, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), with commercial advice and support from the Shareholder Executive, was mandated by Number 10 to take forward preparations for a sale of HMG’s one-third shareholding in Urenco, a uranium enrichment company.  A sale could realise significant proceeds. The project was transferred to BIS (in the Shareholder Executive) through a Machinery of Government change in February 2013. 

","The objectives of the programme are:
• Introduce a modern, integrated and flexible IT system to enable the safe delivery of HE reform (including changes to borrowers’ repayment terms including variable interest rates);
• Enhance customer service and operational efficiency; and
• Support the transformation of SLC’s business through introduction of a unified technology platform and the standardisation of processes.
","The Francis Crick Institute (formerly UKCMRI) is a joint venture between the UK's largest biomedical research and academic institutions: The Medical Research Council (MRC), Cancer Research UK (CRUK), the Wellcome Trust, University College London,  Kings College, London and Imperial College, London.  A new research Institution will be established involving the construction of a new facility located close to St Pancras station, London.  This facility will accommodate 1,268 scientists when fully operational.  The National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) will be closed.  This NIMR site at Mill Hill and the National Temperance Hospital site will be disposed of as part of this project.  The project aims are: Sustain UK's position as a leader in biomedical research; Engagement with the most challenging research questions; Be on a scale to compete with major new overseas developments; Promote the health of the public and wider UK economy; Address key concerns of 2006 Cooksey review on publicly-funded healthcare research; Excellent training environment for biomedical research.","The Electoral Registration Transformation Programme was set up to deliver Individual Electoral Registration (IER) in England, Wales and Scotland ahead of the 2015 General Election.  Instead of one person filling in the annual registration form and including everyone's details, individuals are expected to complete their own details and give supporting information, i.e. a national  insurance number and date of birth.  At the same time as the move to IER, online registration was made available to make it faster and more accessible.  During the transisition stage the vast majority of current electors (87%) were automatically confirmed on the register by data matching with other public sector data.  The programme aims to tackle electoral fraud and improve the integrity and completeness of the electoral register.  ","National Citizen Service (NCS) is a flagship government programme that gives 16 and 17-year-olds the chance to learn new skills and get involved in their communities. NCS promotes:
• a more cohesive society by mixing participants of different backgrounds;
• a more responsible society by supporting young people’s transition into adulthood; and
• a more engaged society by enabling young people to work together to create social action projects in their local communities.

NCS brings young people together from different backgrounds (e.g. religious, ethnic and socioeconomic) to work together, and teaches them what it means to be responsible and serve their communities. It is a high quality personal development programme that gives young people a chance to prove to themselves and their peers what they can do.  NCS is part of a broader agenda of improving services and outcomes for young people between the ages of 13-19, reflected in the Positive for Youth policy statement published in December 2011.

NCS builds on a substantial range of previous government initiatives that aim to increase voluntary activity among young people and develop their life and citizenship skills. Such initiatives include the National Young Volunteers’ Service and the Millennium Volunteers programme.  The programme also draws inspiration from international programmes such as the Americorps, a programme developed in the United States that supports volunteering and engagement in social action.","The National Cyber Security Programme (NCSP) was put in place as a consequence of the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), with a budget of £650 million over 4 years.  Its aim is to deliver a transformative programme to give the UK a strategic advantage in cyber security and resilience.  The programme is managed by the Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance (OCSIA) in the Cabinet Office. 

With the agreement of Treasury as part of the latest Spending Review, the programme has been extended for a fifth year to 2015-16, with an additional £210m funding. ","The purpose of the programme is to manage the successful delivery of the new pension arrangements against published timetables. Critical success factors:
• Administration system, associated processes and all scheme documentation will be updated to be compliant with final regulations, enabling the scheme administrators (MyCSP Limited) to effectively manage members' benefits under the new scheme in line with SMB Contract requirements.
• All members and prospective members will understand how they are affected by the new scheme, based on regular, clear and effective communication.
• Where members are able to choose when they transfer to the new scheme, members will have had sufficient information to make a choice.
• All employers have been provided with information and guidance to enable them to put members in the right scheme at the right time.","Next Generation Shared Services represents a long-standing commitment allied to the Civil Service Reform Plan to achieve efficiency and cost improvements to back office transactional services in finance, procurement, payroll and human resources services. The Next Generation Shared Services Strategy published in December 2012, established the Government’s strategic goals for Shared Services. 

","ICT contracts for the department are due to expire in November 2015.  This programme is to provide for continuity of operations for ICT services for the CPS beyond Nov 2015. The plan is that the CGI Compass contract will be extended to the end of Mar 2017. The contract will be renegotiated with the Print Services and the Networks and Telephony Services removed from Nov 2015 and Mar 2016 respectively. These services will then be procured through pan-government frameworks (PSN Connectivity, PSN Services and Print Services) prior to removal from the Compass contract. The programme will manage the necessary procurements, contract agreements and service transitions. ","The Enterprise Zones (EZ) Programme is a key part of the Government’s wider plans for local and national economic growth. The 24 Enterprise Zones offer businesses financial incentives, fast track planning and superfast broadband to support the creation of new jobs and business. 
Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) are the key agents overseeing the development of the zones. Delivery is taken forward by varying local partners depending on the exact circumstances of the zone. In the majority of cases, local authorities are closely involved in delivery as will relevant land owners and developers.     
Relevant government departments are working closely with LEPs and other local partners, supporting them to unlock barriers to development and successfully deliver development.  
Since January 2013, the Government has taken a more hands-on approach to manage the programme to ensure no zone is without development by 2015.  Each zone has a series of key actions for LEPs, EZs and Government departments to accelerate progress by 2015.
Programme aims:
• to drive progress in each zone to ensure no Enterprise Zone is without development by 2015;
• to support successful delivery of the 24 EZs so that they create new (net) additional jobs and businesses and contribute to net additional local and national growth.","Disband the Audit Commission and refocus local audit on helping local people to hold councils and local public bodies to account for their spending decisions by: (a) Developing and implementing a new audit regime where all such audits will be regulated within a statutory framework, with oversight by the profession and the National Audit Office (NAO); and (b) Transferring (through outsourcing) the Commission's in-house audit practice into the private sector.","Phase 1 of the Government's Broadband Delivery Programme will deliver superfast broadband (24Mbs+) to 90% of the UK by early 2016 and will deliver universal standard broadband (2Mbps).  This is supported by public investment of over £1.2 billion for delivery to around 4.1 million superfast premises.  This is being delivered through 44 projects and a small number of joint Rural Community Broadband Projects with DEFRA.

Phase 2 of the Government's Broadband Delivery Programme will deliver superfast broadband (24Mbs+) to 95% of UK premises by December 2017, following Phase 1.   This is supported by government investment of £250m, seeking to match with a further £250m of local/European funding, to cover 1 million premises.

BDUK is also running 7 pilots to trial new technologies.","The Government's Mobile Infrastructure Project aims to provide mobile coverage to areas of the UK that have not been covered by the commercial sector by building new mobile masts.  The Mobile Infrastructure Project will improve the coverage of mobile voice and basic data services in some of the most remote parts of the UK. To ensure that benefits of the programme are maximised, it has been extended to 2016.

DCMS have partnered with Arqiva and 4 Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to identify areas of no coverage and build mobile phone infrastructure.  The project is addressing complete ""Not Spots"" and not ""Partial Not Spots"" for State aid reasons.  Not spots are defined as an area which is devoid of network coverage, from all mobile providers.","The New Tate Modern will provide London with a unique public space for a rich collection of international art, combined with educational initiatives for diverse audience groups.  It will benefit the rest of the UK by serving visitors from all regions, and by bringing art and educational initiatives to Tate galleries and Tate partners throughout the UK.  Tate has always been an important driver of inbound tourism to London and the UK:  the New Tate Modern will enhance the museum's ability to draw tourists, and be a major force in projecting the UK's soft power.  In summary, the New Tate Modern will significantly enhance the UK's reputation as a major cultural force in the world.  The new building will be a model of environmental sustainability, setting new benchmarks for museums and galleries in the UK and globally. ","Super-Connected Cities (SCCP) is the Government’s key programme for improving service quality and supporting digital connectivity and business innovation in its major urban areas.  22 super-connected cities will benefit from faster and better broadband for small businesses. Cities will deploy wireless coverage to city centres and inside public buildings.

£150 million Government investment has been allocated to SCCP to provide by March 2015 delivery of:
 - economic growth through faster and better broadband connections by achieving a minimum of 10,000 connection vouchers to  Small/Medium Enterprises (SMEs) across 22 cities;
 - Wi-Fi Hotspots in up to 1,000 public buildings; and
 - Other digital connectivity projects to increase broadband capability by delivering SME business hubs and internet exchanges.","The World Conservation & Exhibitions Centre (WCEC) is a £135 million project to provide 17,000 square metres of space within the Museum for exhibitions, conservation, scientific research, logistics and storage.  It has been designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners. The WCEC will ensure the Museum maintains its position as a leading institution for the study of human culture, in London, the United Kingdom and the World. Through an upgrade of key facilities, the development will address urgent needs in terms of the BM’s infrastructure and will provide a new exhibition space, state-of-the-art conservation and science laboratories and studios, world-class accommodation for the study collection, as well as facilities to support the BM’s extensive UK and international loan programmes. It will allow the BM to enhance the visitor and exhibition experience, lend more artefacts and most importantly continue to preserve the collection for future generations.","The CCS Commercialisation Programme aims to build confidence and drive down costs of developing CCS power projects. It supports practical experience in the design, construction and operation of up to two commercial scale CCS projects, by providing up to £1bn of Government capital funding and negotiating an appropriate Contracts for Difference. The CCS Programme aims to bring forward projects that will help make CCS competitive with other low carbon technologies by the 2020s, enabling existing fossil fuel supplies (gas and coal) to be used more cleanly, maintaining the diversity of our fuel mix. This will reduce emissions from electricity generation, in addition to providing a flexible and predictable supply of low carbon electricity generation that can respond to changes in demand. The CCS Programme will play an important role in meeting our carbon targets flexibly and cost effectively, while maintaining energy security. For more information, see: https://www.gov.uk/uk-carbon-capture-and-storage-government-funding-and-support","The objective of the Dounreay Parent Body Organisation (PBO) competition was to secure a reduction in the cost and time to take Dounreay site to its interim end state by securing a new Parent Body Organisation for the Site Licence Company (SLC) at Dounreay, Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL). Associated with this was to be replacement of the cost reimbursable Management and Operations contract with a Target Cost/Incentivised Fee contract which transferred elements of risk currently held by NDA/HMG to the private sector. The previous plan reflected the cost at £3.5 billion and being achieved by 2038. The successful bid by CDP (Cavendish Dounreay Partnership) reduced the cost by circa £1 billion and brought the interim end state date forward to 2023-2025, although developments during the bidding process which the tenderers could not allow for due to their maturity are yet to be factored in via approved change control.","The aim of the programme is to undertake the necessary reform to the electricity market to ensure the UK can attract the investment in electricity generation needed to have a secure, affordable supply of electricity towards the end of this decade and in the longer-term and to meet its renewable and carbon emission reduction targets in the most cost-effective way.  The key elements of the programme which will deliver this are:                

• The creation of a Contract for Difference (CFD) Mechanism which incentivises low carbon technology and generation (renewables, nuclear and CCS) in a cost-effective way;

• The creation of the Capacity Market Mechanism to ensure that the market has sufficient capacity to ensure security of supply in a cost-effective way; and 

• Putting in place an institutional framework with sufficient credibility to administer the reforms efficiently and effectively.
","The aim of Final Investment Decision (FID) Enabling for Hinkley Point C  is to avert an investment hiatus in the deployment of low carbon electricity generation caused by the announced reform of the electricity market, in the period between the publication of the EMR White Paper and the full implementation of the EMR Contracts for Difference  (CFD). ","The aim of Final Investment Decision (FID) Enabling for Renewables is to avert an investment hiatus in the deployment of renewable electricity generation caused by the announced reform of the electricity market, in the period between the publication of the EMR White Paper and the full implementation of the EMR Contracts for Difference (CfD). ","The primary objective of the programme is to site and construct a permanent geological disposal facility (GDF) as the safe, secure and environmentally responsible solution to the long-term management of higher-activity radioactive waste in the UK, excluding Scotland. The programme also supports the delivery of  the UK’s  nuclear new build programme because before development consents for new nuclear power stations are granted, the Government needs to be satisfied that effective arrangements exist or will exist to manage and dispose of the wastes they will produce.","The Household Energy Efficiency programme aims to improve the energy efficiency of domestic housing stock in the UK. It promotes a step change in the delivery of energy efficiency measures, by encouraging private finance. The new Green Deal market framework and Energy Company Obligation (ECO) helps to meet legally binding carbon budgets, support seasonal energy security, tackle fuel poverty and help consumers reduce energy bills over the long term. The programme is designed to remove financial and quality barriers for consumers (by providing standards in the market place), stimulate demand and incentivise companies to engage with the market to deliver energy efficiency measures.

The Programme’s Major Milestone is to see one or more energy efficiency improvement measures fitted in 1 million households by March 2015 with support from one of the following:
a. Energy Company Obligation
b. Green Deal Incentives
c. Green Deal Communities
d. Green Deal Private Finance
e. Green Deal Operations
","The objective of the Parent Body Organisation (PBO) competition was to secure a reduction in costs measured against the extant baselines of Magnox and RSRL. The performance obligations associated with delivery of this objective are embodied within a Client Specification which forms the basis of the Site Licence Company Agreement (SLCA) and Parent Body Agreement (PBA). Following the application of competitive tension via the competition process, it is intended that a target cost incentivised pricing arrangement will be put in place for delivery  of the performance obligations of the contract at a lower target cost as compared against the extant baselines for Magnox and RSRL. A maximum contract period of 14 years is contemplated with an initial term of some 7 years. Current anticipated funding requirements for the initial period of the contract is circa £4 Billion but this will be adjusted to approximately £2.4 Billion (the Target Cost bid for phase 1) with the addition of some reconciliation items following Due Diligence and consolidation of the contractors delivery plan. Following award of contract, there will be provision for mid-term break points at the sole discretion of NDA at low cost on two years notice. Discussions with HMG concluded that the competition should be conducted against the current Magnox baseline and the optimised RSRL baseline with the expectation of securing at least a 5% reduction as a result of competition. Contract was awarded on 1st September 2014. The final savings opportunities offered by the winning bid are of the order of 35%. ","The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) is one of the Government’s mechanisms for driving the transition to deployment of renewable and low carbon heat over the coming decades. The RHI is a key contributor to achieving the UK’s share of the EU’s 2020 renewable energy target and the carbon reduction target set out in the Carbon Plan.

The RHI provides financial support to renewable heat generators and producers of biomethane that is designed to help address the additional cost associated with renewable technologies in order to incentivise their take up.

The RHI for the non-domestic sector launched in November 2011 and the RHI for the domestic sector launched in April 2014.  Both schemes are administered by Ofgem. ","The Government's vision is for every home in Great Britain to have smart electricity and gas meters by 2020. Smart Meters will give consumers up-to-date information about how much gas and/or electricity they have used in pounds and pence, as well as units of energy.  Smart meters will have benefits for consumers, suppliers and energy networks. Consumers will have near real-time information about their energy use, enabling them to monitor and manage their energy consumption, save money and reduce carbon emissions.  Switching between suppliers will also be made simpler. Energy suppliers will have access to accurate data for billing and will be able to offer a wider range of services and tariffs.  Energy networks will have better information to manage and plan current activities and support the move towards the development of a smart grid. ","The primary objective of the Common Agricultural Policy Delivery Programme (CAP D) is to procure a solution for the processing, payment and accounting of claims for funding from all schemes as part of CAP2013. Pillar 1 (Direct Payments and Market Measures) is administered by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) and Pillar 2 (Rural Development Programme) is delivered across RPA, Forestry Commission and Natural England. The secondary objectives are to develop and implement a strategy for the Legacy systems and schemes ensuring that scheme year 2013/14 can be completed properly and scheme year 2014/15 can be supported; to enable the satisfactory transition from current solutions during the 2014/15 scheme year; and to meet the remaining audit requirements. It will facilitate options for organisational change in the medium term for the Delivery Bodies that administer CAP schemes. The Programme will focus on (i) identifying the preferred solution for the future CAP schemes covering both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2; (ii) procuring the preferred solution in time for the implementation of the reformed CAP; and (iii) successfully managing transition for customers from existing schemes and delivering an improved customer experience aligned with HM Government digital strategy. 
The two key strategic drivers are (i) the need to improve the quality of services provided by Defra Delivery Bodies to their customers (also ensuring good value for money); and (ii) to operate new schemes which have emerged from CAP2013 reforms.
","The Environment Agency’s Thames Estuary 2100 (TE2100) Plan provides a strategy for protecting London and the Thames Estuary from tidal flooding to the year 2100 and beyond.  This is work to maintain and improve the existing system of flood risk assets, including the Thames Barrier and associated gates and the 350km of walls and embankments. The cost of maintaining and improving these flood risk assets is justified by the high value of assets protected. Over 1.25million people live and work in the tidal flood plain and £200bn of property is at risk. Other assets at risk include four World Heritage sites, the centre of national government and the London Underground as well as other key sites of national and international importance. 
The TE2100 Plan sets out the Environment Agency’s short, medium and long-term programmes of investments and other recommended actions to manage tidal flood risk through to the end of this century and into the 22nd century.  The Plan is based on a managed adaptive approach which ensures that the right investments are made at the right time allowing for adjustments to be made in timing of works on the actual impacts of sea level rise.  The TE2100 Strategic Outline Programme, which describes the delivery of the programme through a number of phases, was approved by Defra and HMT in 2012. 
This report relates to the first package of works within the strategy – the Thames Estuary Phase 1 (now re-named Thames Estuary Asset Management 2100 Programme). The scope of this is a contract with a private sector partner to deliver a 10-year programme of the capital works, currently estimated to have a value of £310m, plus set-up costs of circa £5m.
","Population growth, increased urbanisation and changes in rainfall patterns mean that London’s sewerage system, largely built in the late 19th century, is operating close to capacity and as a result discharges of sewage to the Thames are occurring regularly and not just as exceptional events. This is unacceptable on environment and health grounds. The proposed Thames Tideway Tunnel is the most cost effective, comprehensive and timely solution to address the problem of combined sewer overflows into the Thames in London, and is due for completion in 2023. In principle the duty to build the Thames Tideway Tunnel falls to Thames Water (who lead the project) and oversight of customer interests falls to Ofwat. As lead Department, Defra is responsible for the regulatory regime for the water sector and is exposed to the risk of fines arising from a European Court of Justice case, which has found the UK in breach of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive in London. Defra is providing a contingent support package to the Infrastructure Provider to ensure that they are able to raise the necessary finance in the capital markets.  Defra is working with stakeholders to ensure continued value for money for Thames Water customers and UK taxpayers.","• Building Schools for the Future (BSF) was conceived as a long-term programme of investment and change in England to help transform education for 3.3 million students aged 11-19.  Although originally planned as a 15–20 year programme, it was announced by the Secretary of State for Education on 5 July 2010 that only projects that had achieved OBC approval by 1 January 2010 would continue.   
• The BSF programme was designed to enhance the learning opportunities of young people by providing new or substantially refurbished facilities capable of delivering a 21st century curriculum.
• The programme also sought to:
    • provide teachers with 21st century work places; 
    • provide a step-change in the level of information and communications technology (ICT)   provision;
    • deliver the investment as efficiently as possible, through a standard procurement and delivery approach – the local education partnership (LEP).

Since the decision was taken to allow only those projects beyond OBC by 1 January 2010 to continue, an exercise was undertaken in late 2010 to identify savings from the remaining programme. C.£250m was duly identified as efficiencies. 


","On 24 May 2012, the Secretary of State confirmed that the Priority School Building Programme (PSBP) would rebuild, or meet the condition needs of 260 schools.   The programme will address the needs of 214 schools through capital grant and 46 schools through private finance.
To ensure value for money for the public sector, the schools have been grouped together in “batches” to make projects that will be commercially attractive and drive strong competition.  

Under the private finance element of the programme there are 5 batches of schools being delivered via PF2, the government's new approach to private finance.

The following objectives have been agreed for the private finance element of the PSBP: 

1. to rebuild or meet the condition needs of 214 schools, prioritising those in worst condition using private finance funding; 
2. to build more for less; 
3. to use a centralised procurement model in order to drive efficiencies in procurement, time and ensure that a quality solution is obtained at the lowest cost; and 
4. to gather data that will enable the efficient delivery of future school buildings e.g. data on cost, timelines, energy usage etc.

","The project aims to establish sustainable air services to St Helena to promote economic development and increased financial self-sufficiency, leading eventually to graduation from UK budgetary support. 

This is being done through the construction of an airport and the introduction of scheduled air services.  The project also includes support to the operation of the airport for a period of ten years and the construction of a wharf.  The project has established the necessary legal, regulatory and monitoring framework, and includes a series of reforms currently being  implemented by the St Helena Government to open up the island to inward investment and increased tourism.","The A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon Improvement Scheme will comprise:

Huntingdon Southern Bypass (11.8 miles / 19km):A1 Trunk Road Improvements including Alconbury to Brampton:A14 Trunk Road Improvements (10.5 miles / 17km): .De-trunking of the existing A14 from Brampton Hut to Fen Drayton and from Alconbury interchange to Spittals. 

Overall Objectives, as agreed with DfT (and revised to omit references to tolling in light of the announcement on 03/12/13 that the scheme would not be tolled).
a) To support and enhance the role of the current A14 between Cambridge and Huntingdon as a major national (Trans-European Network) and inter-urban regional transport artery.
b) To develop the options from the DfT A14 study to provide additional capacity, increase journey time reliability, by improving and better managing traffic flow conditions, and ensure the safe and economic operation of the trunk road.  
c) To determine the optimal funding strategy taking account contributions from local authorities and partners.
d) Is affordable whilst maximising the benefit/cost ratio and hence value for money. 
","The Crossrail programme will deliver a new high-frequency rail service and supporting infrastructure for London and the South East.  A key part of this is the construction of twin tunnels, each 21km long, through the heart of Central London. When it opens (in stages from 2018) Crossrail will run from Reading / Heathrow in the West to Shenfield in the East / Abbey Wood in the South East. Crossrail will create economically-vital new transport infrastructure to support London’s growth, delivering faster journey times and providing an uplift in rail-based transport capacity. It will put an additional 1.5 million people within 45 minutes of London’s business centres, facilitating employment growth of up to 30,000 jobs by 2026 in Central London.","HS2 is the Government project to build a new North-South railway.  The case for the new line rests on the capacity and connectivity it will provide. We need this capacity because our railways are increasingly busy and in the future, as our economy and our population grows, we will travel even more. We need the connectivity because bringing people together drives economic growth. Our current transport system is already under strain and a constraint on growth. Among the many alternatives that have been considered – including new motorways and upgrades to the current rail network - HS2 is the best way of getting ahead of current demand on our core transport network. 

The new north-south railway is a long term solution to a long term problem. Without it the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main Lines are likely to be overwhelmed. With it, we will transform intercity travel, radically improve commuter services into London and our other major cities and increase the amount of rail freight. 

These transport improvements will help support economic growth and make a major contribution towards rebalancing the economy.
The new railway will be built in two phases. It will be fully integrated with the rest of the railway network. It will bring benefits to places with stations on the new railway including Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and London; to stations on the classic network like Liverpool, Darlington and Newcastle which will receive high speed services; and to other places on the existing mainlines like Milton Keynes, Rugby and Peterborough which will have better services from released capacity on the existing main lines","IEP serves London to Bristol, Cardiff, Swansea, Cheltenham and Worcester and London to Leeds, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. It offers through trains from non-electrified lines routes without the need to change or attach a locomotive. The programme is the means to deliver the outputs of the complimentary upgrades to the Great Western and East Coast routes and aims to reduce whole life/whole system costs. 
IEP will start to enter service in 2017 with all trains delivered by 2020. IEP is a flexible design that can be rolled out onto other routes in due course. IEP will deliver between 28 and 40% more peak seats, reduce journey times by around 20 minutes and deliver significant reliability improvements. ","As part of the Office of Rail Regulation's Periodic Review, Government is required to publish a High Level Output Specification (HLOS), setting out information about what the Secretary of State wants to be achieved by railway activities during Railway Control Period 5 (1 April 2014 to 31 March 2019); and a Statement of Funds available (SoFA), setting out the public funds that are or are likely to become available to secure delivery of the HLOS.  This fulfils the statutory obligation required by paragraph 1D(1) of Schedule 4A to the Railways Act 1993 as modified by the Railways Act 2005.

","A major programme to secure the provision of passenger rail services as set out under the Railways Act 1993 (as amended). The Department seeks to appoint franchisees who will work in the context of partnership to support its aim of providing world class train services that drive economic growth, exceed passenger expectations and deliver sustainable value for money for passengers and taxpayers. Franchises are to be let on a rolling programme that will cover all passenger franchises let by Government to 2021.  ","To manage the delivery of Search And Rescue (SAR) contracts for the provision of a search and rescue helicopter service to cover the entire UK search and rescue region. The UK SAR-H contract will replace the MCA contracted service, which runs to June 2017,  and the MOD capability which is due to end in March 2016 when the Sea King fleet is due out of service. The UK Government is committed to a number of international agreements which require a national framework of search and rescue resources to be available within a geographically defined region, currently the service is jointly provided by the MOD at 8 bases and the MCA at 4 bases. The UK SAR-H programme aims to deliver the UK SAR service from 10 bases. The benefit of the service is to save lives. ","The Shared Services Implementation Programme (SSIP), follows on from the successfully completed work of the Shared Services Futures Project which facilitated procurement and contract award (February 2013) for the future provision of back office shared services functions to the Department for Transport (including its Executive Agencies). 

Following the latter procurement process, three preferred bidders were chosen in late 2011 and Competitive Dialogue started in February 2012. Dialogue concluded and final tenders were received, evaluated and Preferred Bidder announced in December 2012. The Full Business Case was approved by the DfT Board Investment & Commercial Committee (BICC), Ministers and HM Treasury by 15 February 2013. On 28 February, the contract was awarded to arvato (part of the Bertlesman Group).

The SSIP is  a key deliverable for the Next Generation Shared Services Programme (NGSS) which is managed by the Cabinet Office. This Programme is focused on the centralisation of transactional functions for Finance, HR, Payroll and Procurement into 2 Independent Shared Service Centres (ISSC).Divestment of the DfT SSC will form ISSC 1 (June 2013). 
The Shared Services Implementation Programme will facilitate a phased migration of DfT Business Units to the Provider's new solution, with all DfT  Business Units initially scheduled to be on the new system by October 2014. ","The £6.5bn Thameslink programme will deliver faster and more reliable journeys for people and businesses and improve accessibility to, from and through the heart of London. 
The Thameslink Programme is comprised of three main elements: enhancements to Network Rail’s infrastructure;  procurement of new depots and 115 Class 700 trains; and the setting up of franchise arrangements for running the passenger service on a new combined Franchise network. ","• Demographic change creates unprecedented challenge. In just 15 years’ time, the number of over-65s will have grown 50% and the number of over-85s will have doubled. The fact that a child born in Britain today has a one in three chance of reaching 100 years of age means this challenge will only get harder.

• Ministers therefore concluded that, to ensure the sustainability of the care we provide, we have to change our focus from simply treating illnesses, to keeping people well and living independently for as many years as possible and integrate our health and social services.

• To drive this they have decided to pool budgets between CCGs and Local Authorities to encourage them to work together and drive the integration agenda forward.  

• Local areas first submitted their BCF plans (detailing how pooled budgets would be planned to be spent in that area) in April 2014. However the quality and aspiration of these plans was not as expected and as a consequence the BCF Task Force was set up on the 7th of July 2014 to work with local areas to improve the quality of plans, assess them and provide assurance to ministers. 

The objective of the policy is to accelerate the local integration of health and care services to deliver better outcomes for patients and service users. 

The Task Force has a narrow focus and its objectives are as follows: 

• Oversee creation of, assurance and sign off plans across the country which utilise the opportunity of the pooled funds to best effect and support achievement of the purpose;
• Support the system to prepare for delivery of plans

By the end of October 2014 all 151 plans will have been assessed and assured against the agreed set of national conditions. They will be given an assessed status of either: approved; approved with support; approved with conditions; or not approved.
The assessment and assurance process will seek to deliver plans that will include:
• A clear analytically driven (i.e. risk stratified) understanding of where care can be improved by integration (of budgets, commissioning, care processes or services)
• A clear and evidence based plan of action, developed with all local stakeholders (CCG, LA, HWBB, NHSE, acute and non-acute providers and primary care providers)
• A coherent and believable delivery chain with clear local management and accountability arrangements  
• A credible way of tracking the impact of interventions, and taking remedial action as necessary
• P4P mechanisms that are agreed and support delivery of the SR settlement and NHS settlement

Given that not all plans will achieve fully approved status, it has already been proposed and approved by the Task Force Programme Board that the Task Force be extended beyond October to support areas to get their plans to a fully approved state and help areas prepare for April. 

The Task Force is currently scoping this Phase 2 of activity which will run from November 2014 through to March 2015. Phase 2 will include the following objectives: 
• To have the majority of plans fully approved and ready for implementation
• To align the BCF plans with BAU NHS and Local Government planning processes
• Support local areas to prepare for and focus on the delivery of BCF plans
• Communicate a strong narrative to the public, and health and social care staff on the value of Integrated Care
• Alignment with other health and social care integration initiatives
• Prepare for and take part in longer term policy development such as the next spending review

Task Force Phase 2 benefits are still being analysed however they are expected to include the raising of the profile of the integrated care agenda with the public and health and social care staff, and a level of assurance around the strength of the implementation of plans in local areas in preparation for April 1st 2015. 

Post March 2015 there will still be much work to be done in order to release the benefits to patient care that the Better Care Fund aims for. CCGs and Local Authorities are free to use their share of the funding to promote integration as they see fit. However, they should meet some national conditions to ensure a minimum level of consistency throughout England. Conditions include ensuring 7 day health and social care services, preventing unnecessary hospital admissions and reducing delayed transfers of care, to making sure one lead professional is accountable for all of a person’s care throughout the new integrated system. 

It is currently unclear whether post March 2015 work will be overseen and monitored via existing structures within Local Government and the NHS or if there will be some requirement for further work or support from a central team such as the Task Force. 

The current Task Force currently has no scope or remit post March 2015. 

","1.  Replacement of the Barry Building at the Royal Sussex County Hospital.

Redevelop Broadmoor High Secure Hospital to replace Victorian accommodation which presents high levels of inherent risk to the safety of patients and staff and has been declared by regulators, including the Care Quality Commission, as 'not fit for modern mental health services'.  The new hospital will provide a total of 234 beds (210 commissioned, 24 decant) in 10 new wards and 6 existing wards in an adjacent unit built in 2003.  It will also provide two support buildings: an entrance building to control all access/egress for the site and a central building to house all ward activities and administration.  The programme includes the realignment of the site boundaries and the sale of surplus land/buildings to support programme funding.
","The purpose of the BT Local Service Provider London  programme is to support IT enabled transformation in the NHS in London to create a more efficient, joined-up and patient-led health service.  The key objectives of the programme are to:
- Provide patients with more choice and control over their patient records;
- Create a health service centred around the patient with health information following patients where they are receiving treatment;
- Provide health professionals and patients with better access to information and enhance the quality of clinical information so that decisions about patient care and treatment can be made quickly and efficiently based on secure and up-to-date healthcare records;
- Help health professionals deliver better patient care by improving the way NHS staff connect  with each other across organisational boundaries and provide them with faster, easier access to reliable electronic patient information;
- transform the way information flows around the health service and help to provide improved and innovative patient services in London.

All IT deployments and upgrades are now complete and the programme is working to i) maximise the benefits that customer NHS Trusts derive from these systems and ii) work with NHS Trusts and suppliers to ensure a safe and orderly exit from the BT Local Service Provider arrangements in advance of contract end on 31 October 2015. 
","The purpose of the BT Local Service Provider South  programme is to support IT enabled transformation in the NHS in the South to create a more efficient, joined-up and patient-led health service.  The key objectives of the programme are to:

","The NHS has some of the best information systems in the world. Since the 1980s, we have been collecting information about every hospital admission, nationwide. This information is brought together at the Health and Social Care Information Centre, where it is anonymised. The information has been invaluable for monitoring the quality of hospital care, for planning NHS services, and for conducting research into new treatments. Whilst we have this type of information for some care provided outside hospitals, there are significant gaps meaning that it is not possible to see a complete picture of the care that individuals receive. NHS England has therefore commissioned a programme on behalf of the NHS, public health and social care services to address these gaps. Known as the care.data programme, this initiative will ensure that there is more rounded information available to citizens, patients, clinicians, researchers and the people that plan health and care services. Our aim is to ensure that the best possible evidence is available to improve the quality of care for all.
           ","The Care and Support Reform Programme is the most significant and far-reaching programme of reform in adult social care undertaken in over 65 years.  It will have a profound impact on the way the care and support system works, the responsibilities of local government and partners, and the rights, outcomes and experience of people who need care, carers and their families. 

The 'Caring for our future' White Paper published in July 2012 set out a wide ranging set of proposals that provide the framework for transforming care and support including:  refocusing the care system onto prevention and early intervention;  strengthening integration across the care and wider support system; empowering people through transparent information on the quality of the care; supporting communities and neighbourhoods to play a more active role; embedding person-centred care and supporting carers; creating a vibrant, sustainable market to support choice; a commitment to implement a cap on care costs. The new system will promote people’s well-being by enabling them to prevent and postpone the need for care and support, and put them in control of their lives to pursue opportunities, including education and employment, to realise their potential.

The programme supports realisation of the vision for care and support set out in the White Paper by:
• delivering the legal framework, including the Care Act 2014, regulations and statutory guidance.
• ensuring that appropriate local government implementation plans are in place for April 2015 and April 2016 milestones and providing assurance on state of readiness.
• providing national leadership and practical support for implementation, including communications materials, specifications (e.g. data standard and interoperability requirements) and learning and development.

Implementation of the programme occurs in two phases.  Phase 1, introduced from 1 April 2015, will see the implementation of a large number of generally lower-risk reforms that will have the greatest effect on the provision of care and support.  Phase 2 changes, introduced from 1 April 2016 will see the implementation of a smaller number of higher-risk reforms, related to funding of care and support and the creation the cap on care costs. Together these reforms represent a major change programme across 152 local authorities and their partners. ","Influenza is a viral infection of the respiratory system.  For some people, especially older people, young infants and people with underlying health conditions, it can cause serious even life-threatening complications and death. The impact of influenza on the population varies widely from year to year due to changes in the virus. However, one recent estimate considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) suggest that each year, on average, approximately 0.75 million people may consult their GP, approximately 27,000 people may be hospitalised and 4,700 people may die in England because of influenza. Currently the programme provides influenza vaccination on the NHS for people aged 65 years and older and those aged under 65 with certain underlying health conditions (e.g. those with chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, pregnant women etc). 

JCVI has recommended that the current flu programme is extended to children aged 2 to less than 17 years. DH has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution , to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective. The evidence reviewed by JCVI suggests that the extension to the current seasonal flu programme might result in around a 40% reduction in the death and hospitalisation figures shown above across the population, although there is large uncertainty either way in this estimate.  For this reason, JCVI recommends that the impact and cost effectiveness of the extended programme be reviewed within five years of the introduction to assess whether the expected benefits have been realised.
","The key objectives of the programme are:
• To manage a safe withdrawal from the existing CSC Local Service Provider contract in a way that empowers local choice, protects patients and is value for money;
• Assure  the investment cases of NHS Trusts who choose to invest in CSC’s electronic patient record system Lorenzo and to provide support to broker the relationship between these NHS Trusts and CSC during the IT service deployment;
• Maximise benefits from the investment over the remaining life of the CSC Local Service Provider contract; and maximise the Return on Investment the Department of Health achieves from the existing deployed and future planned services; and
• Take opportunities to drive up value for money.","UK wide changes to the death certification process are in development, with England and Wales proposing a unified approach to all deaths not investigated by the coroner.  A new system of scrutiny of deaths to address weaknesses identified by the Shipman Inquiry and more recently among others, the Francis Inquiry into poor care at Mid Staffordshire.  In England and Wales, the introduction of medical examiners into the process will provide independent scrutiny of all deaths not investigated by the coroner.  Medical examiners, appointed by local authorities in England and by local health boards in Wales, will either confirm the cause of death stated by a doctor or refer the death to the coroner for investigation.  For all deaths scrutinised by a medical examiner, the cause of death will be explained to the bereaved and an opportunity offered to raise any concerns, which will be acted upon.   In addition to safeguards for the public, anticipated wider benefits include more accurate certification, better quality of mortality data for service planners, appropriate referral of deaths to the coroner and the ability for doctors and coroners to readily have access to general advice from medical examiners in relation to a particular death.                        ",This is the fourth and final stage of the Our Changing Hospitals Programme which enabled full consolidation of all acute services onto the Lister site in October 2014.  The programme formed the heart of the organisations strategy and addressed a number of clinical and financial challenges:- allowing us to achieve best clinical practice and improve outcomes and productivity; providing the means for our response to the challenging economic conditions through QIPP; create a mass of clinical and specialist staff to sustain a wider range of high quality services and introduce new technologies; facilitate modernisation of our facilities and improve patient experience whilst enabling reductions in estate and related costs through reshaping the QEII site; to offset the income loss and support the revenue consequences of the capital investment on the Lister site.,"The Electronic Transmission of Prescriptions Programme is delivering the Electronic Prescription Service which is a national service that has its origins in government policy initiatives from 1998. 

With 1.7 million prescriptions generated every working day in England and a predicted annual rise of 5 per cent, the Electronic Prescription Service provides an alternative means of generating and processing the growing number of prescriptions.  The NHS Electronic Prescription Service enables prescribers, such as GPs and practice nurses, to send prescriptions electronically to a dispenser (such as a community pharmacy or dispensing appliance contractor) of the patient’s choice. Dispensing contractors can subsequently send electronic reimbursement endorsement claims to the NHS Prescription Service. 

The main aims of the Electronic Transmission of Prescriptions programme are:
   o To enable the electronic transmission of prescription data in England between:
         - Prescribers (GP, nurses, supplementary);
         - Dispensing contractors (community pharmacy, dispensing doctors and dispensing appliance contractors); and
         - Reimbursement Agencies (e.g. the Business Services Authority’s NHS Prescription Services).
    o  To facilitate the efficient, convenient and accurate dispensing of medication to patients. The scope of the programme covers all primary  care prescribing and dispensing (excluding Schedule 2 and 3 controlled drugs) and supply of medicines, drugs, appliances and chemical reagents by authorised dispensing contractors. Secondary care prescriptions issued for dispensing in the community are also within scope
    o  To enable the NHS Prescription Service to re-engineer their processes to increase capacity and reduce the unit cost of processing prescriptions.

The Electronic Prescription Service has to date delivered Release 2 Phase 3, which allows patients to nominate a pharmacy of their choice, at which to receive their prescription electronically.  The move to Phase 4 will allow a patient to take their prescription token to any pharmacy for dispensing (as they do with their paper prescription today) with the ability to nominate a specific pharmacy continuing for those patients who prefer the service.

","The programme combines a wide range of measures to: (a) address the specific recommendations of the public inquiry into Mid Staffs NHS Trust (b) respond to patient, public and parliamentary concerns about whether care in the NHS, and to an extent in social care, is sufficiently consistent in the provision of safe, effective, respectful and compassionate care.  Drawing on a range of policy instruments, it combines strong national leadership signals with improved institutional and professional regulation; radical transparency on performance; enhanced arrangements for identifying and addressing failure; improved leadership capability focused on safety and compassion; a stronger voice for patients within the care system; support for staff to raise concerns safely; support for staff to manage more effectively the emotional burden of care.  In short, to transform the culture of the health and care system generally and to give patients a more reliable expectation and experience of high quality care.  As a multi-faceted programme at both national and local levels there is no single measure of success, but rather a broad range of indicators – clinical outcomes, patient experience, staff attitudes, staffing levels, safety incidents, how well led an organisation is, and how likely the staff would be to recommend it to friends and family among others – which combine to give a broad dashboard on quality for individual institutions, care pathways and which combine to give a national picture.  Based on the Nuffield study (see http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/ratings-review ), the Ratings regime under development by CQC will be the key instrument for assessing progress against the multiple impacts that the programme is seeking to achieve.  While we and CQC have commissioned evaluation and research to understand better the impacts of the programme on its broad and complex aims, it is unlikely that these will provide a simple assessment of success for the programme or a moment at which a classical programme could close down the work as completed. ","The objectives of the proposed investment in a replacement for General Practice System of Choice are:
• Establish commercial and management arrangements for GP IT that facilitate an open and informed market over the life of this investment;
• Support delivery of efficiency savings in General Practice by facilitating better use of existing GP IT and by adopting more mobile working technology and patient facing transactional services over the life of this investment;  
• Develop new IT functionality that responds to the evolving needs of patients, practices and commissioners and the wider NHS. In particular, develop interoperability to deliver information to point of care, provide data to support commissioning and improve care pathway management; and
• Improve security of patient data by providing practices with the option to migrate to centrally hosted services over the life of this investment.
","The primary aim of this programme is to deliver the Prime Minister's commitment to sequence 100,000 whole human genome samples by December 2017. 

The  government set out three key objectives for genomics in the next phase of its Strategy for UK Life Sciences published in December 2012 which can be categorised simply as health, wealth and growth:

* to harness the potential of genomics technology by the NHS to improve patient outcomes and healthcare – health;
* to maximise the opportunities for research and translation of research findings into health and economic benefits for the UK –  health and wealth;

","In its 2010 Coalition Agreement, the Government committed to increasing the number of health visitors by an extra 4,200 FTE above the May 2010 baseline by April 2015. Ministers want the extra capacity to bring with it the ability for local teams to improve public health outcomes for the under-fives, with health visitors having the time to provide parents with critical health and development advice, and to connect families to the array of health and wider community resources that help them to give their children the best start in life.  

As part of the Government’s Health Visitor Programme, a commitment was made to improve the quality of services offered to parents and families in the early years of a child’s life.  It has been shown that high quality early intervention, prevention and support is vital to giving children the best start in life. The expansion of the health visiting service is intended to deliver a four-tiered model of health visitor delivery of the Healthy Child Programme to all, with support for all parents and early help when needed. It aims to: improve access to evidence-based interventions; improve the experience of children and families; improve health and wellbeing outcomes for under-fives; and ultimately reduce health inequalities.

Commissioning of health visitor services will transfer to Local Authorities on 1 October 2015. It is essential to the sustainability of the programme that commissioning of public health services for 0-5s is effective and embedded alongside the commissioning of other early years services. A multi-agency task and finish group was established in June 2013 to plan and deliver the transfer. This was superseded in September 2014 by a full programme board.","The aim of the Liaison and Diversion programme is to improve health and criminal justice outcomes for offenders (or suspected offenders) with mental health, substance abuse, personality disorder, learning disabilities and other vulnerabilities.  This should be achieved by investing in Liaison and Diversion services to screen, assess and refer offenders at the earliest possible point of the criminal justice system into relevant treatment and support, so that information from assessments is subsequently fed into the criminal justice process and can be used to inform decisions about justice outcomes, charging, prosecution and sentencing.  This fits with the strategic aims and objectives (offender rehabilitation to support reduced offending, and improved health and wellbeing outcomes) of each of the departments involved.  It is accepted by the Coalition Government that this direction of travel supports the business needs, as it was anticipated that early intervention and investment in health services for offenders across England will save money through reduced ongoing impacts on the criminal justice system.  The programme is led within NHS England, which has responsibility for commissioning L&D services. Policy work is being taken forward by a cross government programme, funded through the SR settlement to DH and involving DH, Ministry of Justice and the Home Office, working with NHS England and Public Health England.  HM Treasury approved the Outline Business Case in 2013 and trials of a standard service specification commenced in April 2014 (the programme transferred to NHS England on 1 April 2014).","The TIME Project is a multi-phased £130m project which will eventually deliver 285 mental health beds in four/five sites across North Merseyside. Phase I comprises a new 80 bedded unit on the old Walton General site (£25m) and an 85 bedded unit in Edge Lane/Old Swan (£27m).  The Phase I buildings are being procured under the NHS LIFT Initiative in conjunction with Liverpool and Sefton Health Partnership (LSHP).   Phase II will follow but may be procured via other routes.   The new accommodation will be single room en suite with access to outside and therapy spaces.  It will replace functionally unsuitable accommodation currently based on a number of disparate sites.  This will release significant land for sale. The two Phase I schemes have now been designated for separate Financial Close, with Edge lane/Old Swan expected to be at least one year behind.  Financial Close for Walton was achieved in February 2013.  This return covers Phase I only with only the Walton aliment currently scheduled.",The aim of the project is to re-procure the National Pandemic Flu Service to ensure that a complementary service to primary care remains ready to be mobilised to enable the rapid distribution of antivirals to symptomatic patients.,"To develop a full PBT service in England that delivers the following aims and objectives:- 
1) to ensure that all patients, for whom evidence supports PBT as the most clinically effective treatment, receive treatment within a clinically appropriate service specification and to nationally agreed standards. 
2) to ensure that services provided enable the continued development of the technologies involved and that workforce and training issues are appropriately addressed. 
3) to deliver improved outcomes by ensuring that patients have access to high quality modern radiotherapy techniques comparable to those used in other European countries, to improve patients' experience by minimising any long term side effects of treatment. In particular to :- 
a) develop a PBT service that meets the objectives as stated in the SOC December 2011 
b) oversee the facilities projects to ensure that the two sites develop a service that meets Commissioner's specifications to time and budget 
c) monitor the facilities projects financial governance arrangements to ensure that it delivers value for money 
d) manage the transition from an overseas service to a service in England 
e) identify and manage the impact of the PBT service on other clinical services 
f) develop a national clinical network 
g) ensure that a research strategy is in place that informs the future development of the service 
h) manage the impact of workforce across radiotherapy services. ","
NHS Choices (www.nhs.uk) is the digital channel for the NHS. It receives over 43m unique visits every month and usage of the site has grown annually since launch. NHS Choices allows users to access comprehensive, clinically valid information on health conditions and information about health and social care services and performance. 

NHS Choices is designed to meet the requirements of those with health or care needs, either directly (e.g. patient or service user) or indirectly (e.g. carer). It will focus on the following objectives responding to core user needs, including:

• Prevent ill health and promote good health: e.g. I want to improve my health and/or wellbeing or avoid past experiences of poor health;
• Promote early intervention: e.g. I have a symptom, I need help;
• Reassure and give confidence: e.g. I have a diagnosis or question related to my care, what do I do;
• Access to services or treatment: e.g. I need a service, how do I choose and access it; and
• Motivate: e.g. I have an illness and I am not involved in planning my care.

A programme of transformation is required to develop a service which meets these objectives. The current service has not changed substantively since launch in 2007.  NHS England and the Health and Social Care Information Centre are developing a plan for delivery of this transformation programme as well as a definition of the scope of the minimum viable service. In parallel, NHS England is developing the business case to secure investment for the capability and capacity required to undertake transformation activity and maintain the minimum viable service.","This project is about the provision, development and implementation of a new NHS e-Referral Service to succeed the existing Choose and Book service in line with NHS e-Referral Service vision and a significant broader set of strategic drivers. The vision positions the new NHS e-Referral Service as a flagship programme to support paperless referrals and a paperless NHS by 2017, and as a centrepiece of NHS England’s response to the Government’s Digital First and transparency initiatives.

The NHS e-Referral Service project has the following scope:
•         Achieving 100% 'paperless' referrals and bookings in the NHS;
•         Launch vision of what the NHS e-Referral Service is aiming to be.  After launch of the vision there will be a by period of research, communications and engagement with patients, users and stakeholders;
•         Go live of the NHS e-Referral Service to support the NHS and Patients, as a 'like for like' replacement of the existing Choose and Book service that currently supports the NHS and Patients. This includes software development, migration of existing data (such as patient referrals and Hospital Services) and transition activities;
•         A range enhancements and developments to NHS e-Referral Service in line with research completed with patient and professional users within the NHS and Social Care;
•         A replacement national Telephone Appointment Line function for patients to book appointments, following closure of NHS Direct;
•         Transition, exit and de-commissioning of the existing Choose and Book and The Appointment Line services to the new NHS e-Referral Service;
•         Ongoing support of the live NHS e-Referral Service after implementation to ensure resolution of any issues impacting delivery of the service to patients and NHS users; and
•         Programme and Service Management from the Health & Social Care Information Centre covering all aspects of delivery, including supporting business change, communications and stakeholder engagement.","The NHS Electronic Staff Record (ESR) provides payroll and HR services to all NHS organisations in England and Wales, apart from two English NHS Trusts. The service is provided by McKesson UK under a contract with the Department of Health (DH) which expires in August 2014. . 
The NHS ESR Reprocurement Project has been established to replace this expiring contract ensuring that there is no break in the ability of the NHS to pay and manage its employees and to ensure that the service is enhanced and improved to  meet the future needs of the NHS
The project will ensure the ongoing provision of pay services to the NHS and that these services are provided in the most effective and efficient way following the expiry of current contracts. 

Aims
• ensuring that NHS organisations continue to have access to efficient, effective and sustainable solutions to undertake at least the core services currently provided by ESR, including ensuring the continuity of service for NHS staff in relation to their remuneration. 
• ensuring that the organisations continue to achieve the benefits from the current service, documented in the OGC benefits report in 2008 and drive additional benefits from any further investment.
• enabling DH, Ministers, Health Education England and Local Education and Training Boards (LETBs) and other bodies to have timely and accurate macro level data about the NHS workforce such as numbers, profile and skills.
• providing assurance data to the reformed system that a trained workforce is in place to enable supply side management of appropriately trained and skilled health and care workforce.","The NHS Pension scheme is available to all current and past NHS Employees and has circa 2.2 million members.  Currently administered in a co sourced model, through two providers, Equiniti Paymaster and the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA, an ALB to the DH), the Equiniti Paymaster element is due to expire in July 2016.  This project has been established to replace the contract that is to expire, ensuring there is no break in the SofS's ability to meet its statutory requirements to offer the NHS Pension scheme. 

The project will ensure the on-going provision of a pension service to the NHS and that this service is provided in the most effective and efficient way following expiry of the current contract. The specific aims of this project are to:- a) deliver a service that does not adversely affect NHS Pensions business performance and allows continuity of the 1995, 2008 and 2015 pensions service; b) adopt a fit for purpose commercial solution ensuring sufficient flexibility to accommodate transformational change; and c) improve the experience of employers and employees.

In delivering these objectives, the project will aim to:- 1) make provisions for the forthcoming expiry of the contract which covers the functions currently carried out by Equiniti Paymaster and outsource the remainder of the pensions function currently provided in-house; 2) transform the current administration service, to improve customer experience and increase efficiency; 3) ensure the revised pension administration service is agile to change; 4) ensure that the procurement delivers efficient innovative solutions for managing the cost and process of change and delivers a structure which creates coherent incentives for engagement and innovative thinking from all parties; 5) ensure that the resultant systems meet current and future needs and are value for money; 6) ensure that the service is fully and effectively aligned with relevant policies to create value in the delivery of policy as well as within operational services; and 7) support the platform upon which DH workforce can develop future Total Reward Strategies.","The NHS spends over £23 billion every year on goods and services (which typically accounts for around 30 per cent of the operating costs of each NHS Trust) and around £44bn on staff.  In the financial year 2011-12 and in 2012-13, non-pay expenditure in Trusts increased beyond the rate of general inflation.  In August 2013, DH published a report “Better Procurement, Better Value, Better Care“, which proposed, amongst other things, that a Programme should be established to help NHS trusts deliver £1.5bn efficiency savings. The NHS Procurement Efficiency Programme received Phase 1 funding to obtain resources to mobilise the Programme in December 2013, and further interim funding arrangements to maintain Programme progress, were agreed with HMT 15th August 2014.
The Programme aims to: 
• deliver a series of cost saving initiatives with the NHS in the short-medium term;
• improve data, information and transparency within the NHS;
• establish a clinically led approach to medical devices that will deliver opportunities for efficiency and establish a best practice approach to strategically managing these categories across the country; and
• provide leadership, coordination and direction to help modernise procurement in the NHS, embedding world class procurement to increase efficiencies, capability and capacity across the NHS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
In June 2014, Lord Carter was appointed by the Secretary of State for Health as Chairman of the Procurement & Efficiency Board.  He recommended that a Project should be established to identify hospital efficiency metrics that might help NHS Trusts to identify possible efficiency savings. In parallel, work is continuing on identifying and securing savings through partner organisations such as NHS Supply Chain and Crown Commercial Services.
","NHSmail provides a secure email, calendar, directory, fax and SMS text service provided for the NHS in England and Scotland to over 900,000 registered users. Further, NHSmail provides a national relay service which enables NHS organisations in England, Scotland and Wales to communicate. SMS text services provided are used extensively by NHS organisations with over 4.8 million SMS text messages sent each month. Services are centrally funded and are currently free to health and care organisation's at point of use.

NHSmail is a fully operational service, for which demand remains strong. High user satisfaction ratings and strong support from the National Stakeholder Engagement Group and National NHSmail Forum suggests a desire to continue a secure email service for the NHS in some form. The continuation of a need, along with a number of other key infrastructure projects, was confirmed in a Department of Health announcement on 22nd September 2011. 

The existing NHSmail contract was executed on 1st July 2004 for a 9 year term; it expired on 30th June 2014 with transition contract arrangements in place through to Mar-15 and further funding to be signed off in the next business case. The currently contracted supplier for this service is Vodafone. 

The aim of the NHSmail 2 project is therefore to identify a solution and replace the existing single NHSmail service by Jun-16 by working with Crown Commercial Service to get a number of secure email providers onto a Managed Email framework which will allow NHSmail to run a further competition to procure a replacement service provider from the framework including an integration service that will ensure that @nhs.net emails are directed to the correct provider, its customer organisations and their individual users; a central directory and government gateway service.
","New Hospital Development at Wynyard, Teesside - To  respond to both the local health needs, national policy developments, and implement a key recommendation of the Independent Reconfiguration Panel's Report published in 2008.  The Trust, in partnership with its stakeholders, has planned to implement through the' Momentum - Pathways to Health Care Programme' care closer to home with a new hospital facility that is fit for purpose for the provision of modern acute care services. This will deliver a patient-centred and clinically driven local NHS responsive to the needs of the local people, delivering the best quality care available in an integrated and efficient way, in first rate facilities as close to home as possible. The scheme is anticipated to cost circa £272m (excluding VAT) - this is to be funded from a £100m capital contribution from the Treasury and the balance (£172m) to be funded from PF2. ","The launch of the Nursing Technology Fund  has come, in part, as a response to the Government’s commitment to reduce the burden of bureaucracy on nurses and midwives. The Fund will also allow them to use connected information and new technology to join up and improve services, make better informed decisions and deliver safer, more integrated care. 

The projects funded by the Nursing Technology Fund are envisaged to deliver a range of benefits for nurses and midwives helping them:
* improve patient outcomes through access to information and resources at the point of care;
• spend more quality time with individual patients with a heightened level of acuity and dependency;
• reduce unnecessary journeys and overall amount of time spent travelling;
• significantly reduce multiple collections, transpositions and duplication of data;
• significantly streamline care processes by eliminating non-value adding steps; and
• improve access to services and reduce waiting time as a result of releasing time to care.","Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is one of the UK’s leading cardiothoracic hospitals and an internationally recognised heart and lung centre.  It provides services to a core catchment population of approximately three million in Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Mid and North Bedfordshire and surrounding areas and receives referrals for certain sub-specialties from throughout the UK.  The current site dees not provide the ability for the hospital to use the accommodation flexibly and the infrastructure is deteriorating.

The Trust developed a Clinical Vision for the development of its services in conjunction with Addenbrooke’s Hospital, the Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire Strategic Health Authority (now part of NHS Midlands and East), PCTs and other key stakeholders.  

The delivery of the vision is best achieved by the development of the new Papworth Hospital on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus with more integrated, improved services for patients as a result of the partnership with Addenbrooke’s Hospital and the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine.

Therefore the main purpose of this project is to relocate the Papworth hospital to the Cambridge Biomedical Campus.","The programme previously called Chrysalis evolved under the Health Protection Agency (HPA) from a new build on the Porton site to co-location of Porton elements (research, health protection services, and corporate services), along with two other major HPA sites on a single site in the vacated GSK Science Park at Harlow. HPA’s Chrysalis Programme  focused on the urgent re-provision of the ageing, high security, high containment specialist microbiology laboratories at Porton Down that are a key part of the nation’s defence against novel and dangerous microbiological pathogens such as pandemic flu, Ebola, anthrax and many others. 
The programme  transferred to Public Health England (PHE) on 31st March 2013. An independent due diligence review carried out for  PHE supported the continued investigation of Harlow and allowed PHE to continue to explore Harlow as an option for the Outline Business Case (OBC). The vision under PHE has continued to develop and builds upon and strengthens the strategic case for an integrated public health service. The business case is based on the delivery of a “hub and spoke” model for public health science in PHE.The “hub and spoke” model identifies the two core purposes within PHE:
- The national source of advice and expert science on protecting and improving the public’s health
- The local provider of key public health functions and the application of expert advice on public health interventions to local government and the local NHS

This date could be extended further, by testing for potency from this summer onwards).","The programme has recently been renamed as the Health and Social Care Network, formerly called the Public Sector Network for Health. This is to reflect that the future network will support the growing information needs of a more integrated health and social care environment.

Health and Social Care Network is the programme set up, on behalf of the health and social care sector, to enable the provision of a network solution across the Health and Social Care landscape. Key deliverables will be the exit from the existing contract, disaggregation of the services, transition to a range of suppliers and ultimately the transformation of services to a digital, internet based platform, whilst aligning with Government Information and Communication Technology and Digital Strategies; including a reduction in the cost in comparison with the extant solution. 

The programme is currently undertaking a reset and review on its future direction, and  is going through a discovery phase working with subject matter experts to create a Blueprint that contains a strategic roadmap, target operating model and recommendations for a replacement network solution.  A Programme Mandate and  Programme Business Case have been created to develop the roadmap, into a focused and appraised strategic delivery case. The Programme Business Case is progressing through the approvals route.


","Background:  Rotavirus infection is the commonest cause of gastroenteritis in children under five years of age worldwide.   Rotavirus infection in the UK is seasonal, occurring mostly in winter and early spring.   In England and Wales an estimated 130,000 episodes of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis occurred each year prior to the introduction of immunisation in children less than five years old and approximately 12,700 of these children were hospitalised.  In 2011 the Joint Committee on Immunisation and Vaccination (JCVI) advised that the Department of Health should introduce a rotavirus immunisation programme if the vaccine could be procured at a cost effective price.  Following negotiations with the manufacturer, the price paid for rotavirus vaccine resulted in the vaccination programme being cost effective. 
Objective:   The overarching objective of the rotavirus immunisation programme is the reduction of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis in England.   
Scope:  The scope of the project is limited to England and includes all the elements required to successfully deliver a rotavirus vaccination programme.  
Benefits::  the programme is delivering: 
• rotavirus immunisation for babies added to the national immunisation schedule; 
• a reduction of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis: and 
• a reduction in the burden on the NHS by reducing hospital admissions and visits to GPs caused by rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis.
","A new Royal Liverpool University Hospital procured under the Private Finance Initiative. The scheme will address service delivery and building infrastructure concerns. It will secure the future provision of high quality service for the local population, together with specialised services for Cheshire, Merseyside and beyond and support world class research and teaching in partnership with the University of Liverpool. This will be achieved through the implementation of a Clinical Services Delivery Model, the development of services outside hospital, redeveloping or utilisation of facilities at Broadgreen Hospital and redeveloping the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. The existing hospital also presents a significant business continuity risk arising from serious issues concerning fire safety and the engineering structure.","The Trust is the largest specialist orthopaedic hospital in the UK and continues to be regarded as a world leader in the field of orthopaedics despite its ageing and dysfunctional site.  The proposed facility has a capital value of approximately £40m and will include a mixture of approx 100 inpatients beds (Adult Acute and Children and Young People's Services); - Therapy areas for both inpatient service areas; - A new main entrance; - Inpatient and complex imaging.  The new Healthcare Facilities will deliver improvements to clinical adjacencies, forming a main entrance 'hub' in the centre of the existing site, thereby commencing a process of site rationalisation that will deliver improved patient outcomes including: Improved privacy and dignity for patients as the project will deliver 50% single rooms for adults; Improved utilisation of beds as the single sex agenda and infection control will be easier to manage; Improved access to Imaging as the department will be planned to meet current and future activity and changes in technology; An attractive and modern environment to attract and recruit world-class professionals to train and work at the Trust;","The development of a new acute hospital on a brown field site in the Grove Lane area of Smethwick( in Sandwell) to replace the current Sandwell General and City Hospitals, as part of the wider changes to health and social care within the health economy being undertaken in the Right Care, Right Here Programme. This will result in a major shift of care away from the acute hospital into community settings, major investment in new community and primary care facilities and the state of the art new single-site acute hospital proposed in the OBC. 
The SoS has authorised use of compulsory purchase powers and the site has been acquired. The OBC has been approved and procurement has commenced.

","Background:  shingles is caused by the reactivation of the chicken pox virus in a person with a dormant chicken pox infection.  Shingles incidence is highest in older people as the incidence of shingles increases with age. Prior to immunisation being introduced in the UK, there were estimated to be around 790 to 880 cases per 100,000 people, an estimated 30,000 cases of shingles for people aged 70 – 79 each year.  In 2010, JCVI advised that a universal shingles programme should be implemented for people aged 70 years to 79 years inclusive if a licensed vaccine was available at a cost effective price.  The Department of Health (DH) has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution, to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective. 
Objective:  The overarching objective of introducing shingles vaccination is the reduction of shingles and associated sequaelae in England.
Scope:  The scope of the project is limited to England and includes all the elements required to successfully deliver a shingles vaccination and catch up programme.
Benefits:  The programme is delivering: (1) sustained improvements in public health; (2) a reduction in burden on the NHS by reducing the need for treatment and (3) a cost effective health intervention.
Status:  shingles vaccination was introduced on 1 September 2013.   In 2013/14 shingles vaccination was offered to 70 year olds (the routine cohort) and 79 year olds (the catch-up cohort). In 2014/15 shingles immunisation is being offered to all those aged 70, 78 and 70. The catch-up programme will be continued progressively in future years so that all people aged 70-79 years are offered shingles vaccination.
","The South Acute Programme was established in Autumn 2011 to deliver clinical systems for Acute providers in the South of England. The systems, procured locally by providers through this programme, will replace outdated legacy systems and manual processes for the capture of clinical information, enabling a number of benefits to providers, including; reducing the reliance on paper based process, improving safety of care and increasing operational efficiency and effectiveness.  

Providers are working in 6 collaborative groups, each with their own scope, in order to procure and implement systems aligned to local informatics strategy and priorities, with DH providing some central funding to support these local investments.   The service/system scope of each collaborative comprises: 
Group A - Electronic Prescribing and Medicines Administration (EPMA); 
Group B - Electronic Document Management and a Clinical Portal; 
Group C - Community-wide ePrescribing and a clinical hub; 
Group D - An enhanced Patient Administration System (PAS) and a Maternity system; 
Group E - An Integrated Clinical Information System; and 
Group F - Clinical Document Management.
","The Spine 2 programme covers the work required to develop replacement Spine services (a collection of national applications, services and directories that support the NHS in the exchange of information across national and local NHS systems), their transition from the existing Spine services and Spine 2 operation and support services, covering the period 1st April 2012 to 31st March 2018

The main objectives of the Spine 2 programme are  to:

• Maintain continuity of Spine service from the end of the current contract, through any transition of change of supplier(s), to the end of the period covered by the business case;
• Increase the number of external organisations able to connect and develop services on behalf of health and social care providers;
• Reduce the cost and timescale of introducing changes to the Spine services; and
• Reduce the annual cost of providing the service.
","The Summary Care Record supports patient care by providing healthcare staff in urgent and emergency care settings with the essential medical information they need to support safe treatment. The Summary Care Record includes a defined set of key patient data for every patient in England except those who choose not to have one. The overarching aim is that the Summary Care Record will contain only significant aspects of a person’s care, those deemed to deliver benefit to a patient when receiving urgent and emergency care. 

When a patient’s Summary Care Record is first created it will contain details of: Medications; Adverse reactions; and, Allergies from the patient's GP record. 

Patients have a choice to opt out of the Summary Care Record at any time and must give permission for clinicians to view their Summary Care Record. To support this, a Summary Care Record public information programme involves making patients and NHS healthcare staff aware of the Summary Care Record. This includes sending a personalised information pack to all GP registered patients, over the age of 16. ","This Project comprises the Information and Communication Technology systems, services and staffing required to complete the ‘replatforming’ of Secondary Uses Systems (i.e. transfer the application software and data from the existing BT service into new service arrangements) and thereafter provide a live operational service until June 2016, when the payment of hospital activity (along with other healthcare activity within the scope of national NHS tariff policies) will be taken over by a new strategic National Tariff System.  It also includes the development and delivery of an annual software release (Release 15) to update Secondary Uses Systems for the 2015/16 financial year tariffs and rules. 
","The Automatic Enrolment Programme was established to implement the Government’s workplace pension reforms. The overarching aim of the reforms is to get more people saving more for their retirement. The Programme ‘went live’ in October 2012, delivering:   
1) Automatic enrolment - a new duty on employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme; to increase the incentive to remain saving in a pension scheme there is a mandatory employer contribution.
2) The National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) - offers low cost pension provision to individuals on low to moderate earnings and their employers. NEST has a public service obligation to accept any employer who wishes to use it to meet their employer duty. 
3) An employer compliance regime - run by the Pension Regulator to support these measures. 

The implementation period for the Programme is 6 years: employers are being 'staged'  by size, starting with the largest, over the period October 2012 to February 2018; and contributions to pension schemes are being ‘phased’ in over time to provide a period of adjustment for employers and individuals, with full contributions being paid from October 2018. 
Once fully implemented the Department expects to see around 9 million people newly saving or saving more into a workplace pension, and an increase in pension saving of around £11 billion a year.
","The central premise of the Government’s vision is to support separated parents to work together in the interests of their children and set up their own, family-based child maintenance arrangements. For those who are not able to do this, the Department has introduced the 2012 Child Maintenance Scheme, administered by the Child Maintenance Service. 

The 2012 scheme delivered two critical changes to the policy and regulations which both simplified the approach to child maintenance calculations and provided a new IT platform on which it could be administered.
","The Department’s Conditionality Package supports a core principle that underpins the Government’s welfare reform policies: increasing what is required of claimants in exchange for benefits, and strengthening how the Department monitors compliance with that increased conditionality.

The following conditionality and compliance measures make up the package:
1. Day One Conditionality – claimants are required to demonstrate positive job seeking behaviours from day one of their claim by ensuring they have an e-mail address, high quality CV and are registered with Universal Jobmatch.
2. Weekly Work Search Reviews – 50 per cent of pre-Work Programme Job Seekers Allowance (JSA) claimants and Universal Credit (UC) claimants are subject to intensive work search requirements.
3. Quarterly Work Search Interviews – pre-Work Programme claimants in receipt of JSA, and UC claimants subject to intensive work search requirements, are required to attend a 20 minute advisory interview every 13 weeks. 
4. English Language Requirements – claimants being screened to see if they can communicate in English (very basic speaking skills) and, as necessary, mandated to an assessment and English Language training. 
5. Increasing Lone Parent Conditionality for certain groups of lone parents aged 18 and over and nominated carers.
","The Department established the Estates Programme in 2010 to support the efficiency challenge in SR10 and SR13. In February 2014, the Programme’s scope was extended to include work to replace the 20 year contract for DWP buildings, which expires in March 2018. ","In January 2013, the Government published its response to a major review of the sickness absence system in Great Britain.  As part of this review the Government committed to:
• The introduction of a new Fit for Work (FfW) service in England and Wales which will deliver both a supportive occupational health assessment and general health and work advice to employees, employers and General Practitioners (GP).
• The delivery of enablers which allow the Scottish Government to implement FfW in Scotland.  This will provide advice on sick absence (via on-line and telephone) for employers and employees and an assessment service for employees on sick leave for four weeks or more.
• The abolition of the Percentage Threshold Scheme (PTS) to address perverse behaviours among employers who rely on reimbursement through the scheme rather than actively managing sickness absence. The funding from the PTS will be recycled into FfW to support a proactive approach to sickness absence management. 
• The abolition of Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) record keeping obligations, which will lift the administration burden off employers.

The legislative changes to PTS and SSP will be implemented by the Department, with the administrative changes to HMRC operational processes being made via a separate project in HMRC.
","The Fraud, Error and Debt Programme aims to deliver into the Department the means to prevent fraud and error in the first instance; detect and correct fraud and error where it does exist; deliver tough punishments for those who defraud the system; and deter those who would try to abuse the system in future.
The objectives of the Programme are to: 
• Save approximately £2 billion in welfare benefit expenditure by the end of the 2014-15 financial year.
• Contribute to the Department’s target to reduce the level of benefit expenditure overpaid to a maximum of 1.7 per cent by 2015.
• Deliver a single fraud investigation service as a more efficient way of carrying out benefit fraud investigations currently processed separately by DWP, HMRC and Local Authorities.
• Introduce the capability for a range of business users across DWP to access HMRC Real Time Information on earnings and employer data;.
• Deliver a referral and case management system to support improved Fraud, Error and Debt Operations.
• Enable the Government to recover greater levels of debt, and ensure those who move off benefit can still be liable for their debt.
The Programme is adopting a phased delivery approach between 2012 and 2017 and will continue to build on the successful ""Spend to Save"" data matching activity which is well underway to ensure a sustainable reduction in losses in the benefit system. The Programme generated £1.8 billion in savings up to the end of September 2014, and will realise further savings through the life of the programme business case.

","The Department’s Help to Work Package supports the Government’s principle that the longer a jobseeker remains on Jobseeker’s Allowance or Universal Credit (for claimants subject to intensive work search requirements), the more the Department will expect of them to look for and secure suitable employment.  

A new package of Help to Work measures went live in every Jobcentre by 31 December 2014. One third of claimants returning from the Work Programme  will be allocated to one of the following 3 elements depending on individual need:
• Mandatory Intervention Regime (MIR) – coaches have more time to spend with claimants, and can use other support such as referral to training, local provision and using the flexible support fund. This will be a continuous period until the claimants’ barriers to employment have been addressed; claimants who have completed the other two elements will also be referred back to MIR.
• Daily Work Search Reviews – a period of 4-13 weeks of daily activity at the Jobcentre.
• Community Work Placements – a work placement that is of benefit to the community for up to 30 hours per week, and up to 10 hours of job-search activity. 
","This programme will transform the Department’s major commercial vehicles for delivering IT services, as they come to an end between 2014 and 2016.

The objectives of the Programme are to:
• Ensure continuity of supply of IT to the Department.
• Reduce the cost of IT provision relative to the cost of replacing the contracts.
• Improve responsiveness and service levels delivered by our suppliers.
• Maximise future flexibility and avoid lock-in to any supplier.
• Maintain a strong in-house capability to acquire and manage critical IT services.
• Extend the Department’s deals to other Government Departments.
• Introduce smaller companies into the IT supply chain.
• Ensure compliance with Government ICT Strategy;
• Optimise commercial outcomes by seeking the best deal for the Department overall
","The Project will deliver the reforms to State Pension included in the Pensions Act 2014.

These reforms are designed to give greater clarity about the State Pension someone can expect to receive from the Government, address some inequalities in the current system and provide a firm foundation for saving for retirement for people reaching State Pension age from 6 April 2016.

Changes include removing the complexities of the current system by moving to a single state pension set above the level of the basic means tested benefit. This together with abolition of the Savings Credit will provide today’s savers with greater clarity about what they will receive from the State.  It also reduces the number of people reliant on the basic means test. The Department is also abolishing contracting out from defined benefit pension schemes. To ensure fairness the calculation of new State Pension will recognise pre 2016 National Insurance records.

The Department leads the Project, working closely with HMRC to deliver the necessary changes to systems and processes.

The Project will ensure staff in both the Department and HMRC are equipped to deliver the reform and that the changes are communicated to current and future pensioners, employers, trustees and scheme providers at the appropriate time
","Personal Independence Payment replaces Disability Living Allowance for people aged 16-64. It is aimed at those disabled people who face the greatest challenge to remaining independent and participating in society. It provides a more objective assessment of needs and is more responsive to changes in those needs. Claimants can receive PIP whether they are in or out of work. The benefit is not means tested.  

Key features include:
• A dynamic benefit which is simpler to claim and administer.
• A more financially sustainable benefit than DLA that delivers significant AME savings over the life of the investment.
• A standardised Operating Model that efficiently matches the service to claimants’ needs.
• New IT and business processes to enable the application and administration of this new benefit.

The first tranche of activity to accept new claims to PIP commenced in April 2013. 

In October 2013, further activity commenced to assess DLA claimants for entitlement to PIP when their DLA award ends or they notify the Department of a change.

In October 2015, activity to assess all other existing DLA claimants is planned to commence. 
",Universal Credit (UC) involves the merger of six separate benefits and tax credits for working age people bringing together in and out of work systems into one system that attempts to make work pay for everyone. When fully rolled out it is expected that over 7 million households will be in receipt. Legislated for in 2012-13 it has now entered implementation phase.,"To provide fit for purpose and secure offices for the British High Commission (BHC) and DfID in Abuja, Nigeria.  The existing Chancery and unclassified offices are located in split locations, both of which are rented and were opened in 1991 as a 'temporary' solution.   Since then Abuja has firmly become established as the administrative capital of Nigeria and it has been the FCO's intention for some time to have offices that are fit for purpose for the next thirty years, that comply with current FCO security standards and provide an effective platform for a wide cross-section of UK government departments.  Nigeria is one of the FCO's significant priority countries in Africa and presents a unique mix of threats and opportunities for UK interests.    The analysis of the business case options clearly shows that the way to achieve our medium and long term aims in Nigeria is by building new premises on the UK-designated plot leased in 1991 from the Nigerians.   Following the bombing of the UN building in Abuja on 26 August 2011, the FCO Overseas Security Adviser recommended evacuating Dangote House (u/c offices).  Estates and Security Directorate have completed an emergency project to relocate the UKBA and Corporate Services office staff to offices created by converting existing gym and club facilities and three staff houses at one of the staff residential compounds.  It remains the case that the increasing clear and present danger to our staff working in the region is bringing intense pressure for the new BHC office scheme to be moved forward along an accelerated timescale. ","To maintain continuity of the following business critical ICT services as the existing contract expires by procuring new contract(s):
- Firecrest: FCO's Microsoft based global desktop infrastructure (DI) and management contract with Hewlett Packard (H-P). Expired in Feb 2012 . 
- Service & Management Integration (SMI) supplier to manage the FCO's ICT contracts  on the FCO's behalf.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Programme was established to prepare for and carry out the necessary procurement activity, put in place and transition to the DI and SMI contracts, maintain service continuity, enhance the systems and services and deliver significant cost savings in doing so.            

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ","The aim of the project is to ensure the continuation of healthcare to NHS standards from 1 April 2015 for HMG staff posted overseas and their dependants and for staff based in the UK who travel overseas on official business.

Following an EU open procurement exercise, a new contract has been awarded to  Healix International.   Five additional Government departments have joined the scheme so the numbers of staff and dependants covered by the contract have increased from 14,000 to 23,000 .
 The contract will provide medical clearance, case management, access to medical care and medical advice. The FCO and other participating Departments  pay actual medical costs as they are incurred.  

","The FCO wants to maximise the efficiency of its London estate by consolidating its core activities into the Main Building on King Charles Street (KCS). This will support the wider Cabinet Office strategy of consolidating the HMG Estate in Central London. It will free up the Old Admiralty Building (OAB) freehold for other Government Department use. There are significant savings for the FCO on operating costs and for the wider Government on lease rentals. This UK Estates Reform (UKER) project is a catalyst to provide a more modern working environment for FCO staff, to help deliver Diplomatic Excellence, to embed flexible working, and to drive efficiency across the FCO. The FCO must also introduce a new High Classification IT system by 2014, which will involve making a significant part of the KCS building secure releasing OAB for another HMG department.","This investment of staff represents the continuation of our existing operations, but increases the resource deployed on debt collection by 909 FTE over the proposed SR10 reduced resource baseline. Benefits are calculated against the SR10 reduced resource baseline as the counterfactual.  
Investing staff back into our more efficient and effective debt collection model results in additional receipts in the consolidated fund of £1108m over the SR10. 
Even with this investment, DMB will deliver a 9% net FTE reduction across the SR10 period as well as the additional receipts detailed above.
The majority of investment (£56.3m) is paybill with a small amount of capital and resource to enable the transfer of staff into DMB. Operational planning with this investment scenario has demonstrated no scale up costs elsewhere.","HMRC's Digital Portfolio will deliver new and enhanced online services for Individuals, Business customers and the Agent community. 
The Programme will support the delivery of HMRC's Digital Strategy and the introduction of the Cabinet Office new Identity Assurance Strategy by delivering:
- HMRC's four Exemplar Digital Services - PAYE for Employees (formerly PAYE Online), Digital SA, Your Tax Account (formerly Tax for My Business) and Agents Online. (The Agent Online Service (AOSS) is a Digital Exemplar but does not form part of this report.)
- Underpinning digital capability that will provide HMRC with the capability to respond at pace to change, including the introduction of iforms
- New IDA process through PAYE for Employees and our Corporate solution for Business customers. 

The ambition of the revised 2 year Digital Roadmap goes significantly beyond the scope of the digital exemplars and allows us to meet the commitments made by the Department.
","This investment to extend the use of Debt Collection Agencies represents a continuation and expansion of our existing operations. (Departmental funding restrictions had meant there would be no DCA activity planned beyond 2010/11 without investment.)  It provides additional debt collection capability and capacity to allow more debts to be tackled quicker and more effectively, change the behaviours of more customers and generate more revenue.","The One Click Programme of work is made up of 6 projects; Start-up hub, the Tax Dashboard, the Online Tax Registration Service (Registration Wizard), iforms, Transaction Monitoring and VAT Registration Transformation. One Click brings many Tax services (CT, ITSA, VAT and PAYE) that businesses need together in one place, online. Focuses on key events in a business' lifecycle, with information for pre-start ups, a single place to register for business taxes and a self serve facility to view and update details online.","The Organised Crime Project will have a significant impact on the Organised Crime segment of HMRC’s Customer-Centric Strategy.  The key aim is to prevent, disrupt and reduce deliberate, systematic and large scale attacks by Organised Criminal Groups (OCGs), estimated to cost HMRC between £5bn to £7bn per annum. The threat from OCGs is evolving and we need to prevent significant attempted fraud just to maintain losses at their current level. The project will deploy approximately 500 FTEs across a range of new and established interventions to target organised criminals including; joint working with the Border Force (BF), the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and expanding our Fiscal Crime Liaison Officer (FCLO) Network to increase cooperation with foreign administrations. We are also an instrumental part of the Cross Government Strategy to tackle Cyber Crime. We aim to address the threats at each stage of the illicit ‘supply chain,’ improving capabilities in intelligence, civil and criminal investigations. The Project is structured to address the main threats which come from VAT Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC), repayment and registration fraud, diverted alcohol products and cigarette and tobacco smuggling. 
During 2012-15 we will change our approach to organised crime to target the key individuals behind the fraud using new intelligence gathering methods and new technology capabilities that will support this approach.",Real Time Information is the next stage of improving PAYE through the use of real time information.  It will deliver a series of projects to implement measures designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the PAYE system.  This will underpin the introduction by the Department for Work and Pensions of the Universal Credit regime.,"At Budget 2013, the Government announced the introduction of Tax-Free Childcare to benefit and support up to 1.9m working families. The Government will provide 20 per cent of working families’ childcare costs, subject to an annual limit of £2,000 contribution from the Government for each child. This is equivalent to basic rate tax relief of childcare costs up to £10,000 a year. The projects aims are to implement this policy.","HMRC is revising its approach to tackling fraud in the Rule Breakers customer group, increasing the number of criminal investigations and subsequent prosecutions in this group. This approach is called Volume Crime and will: deter rule breakers and potential rule breakers from fraudulent behaviour; enhance the effectiveness of civil interventions by evidencing the downsides of non-compliance; and show HMRC is relentless in pursuit of those who break the rules.  The Volume Crime project aims to significantly increase productivity and resources deployed to criminal investigation. 240 staff years will be deployed as a result of this project in Criminal Investigation and associated Risk and Intelligence Service functions, with prosecution numbers rising through the SR10 period to an additional 1,000 prosecutions delivered per year from 2014/15. The considerable increase in activity in the rule breakers segment increases the perceived risks to potential rule breakers and thus deters individuals from going down the path of tax evasion and therefore an increase in ""voluntary compliance"" due to the deterrent effect. 
The project is currently creating a research programme to measure this deterrent effect.","In May 2010 the Coalition Government pledged to “implement the Parliamentary and Health Ombudsman’s recommendation to make fair and transparent payments to Equitable Life policy holders, through an independent payment scheme, for their relative loss as a consequence of regulatory failure.” The scheme was set up rapidly, so that those who suffered losses as a result of maladministration were able to receive payments as early as possible.  As a result the Government’s stated ambition for payments to begin by the end of June 2011 was met. Payment volumes started to increase from November 2011, with the scheme moving into full operation during 2012-13. By end Q3 2014/15 (end December 2014) the Scheme had issued payment to the value of c.£998 million to c.893K (86% of total) policyholders.

In October 2013 the Chancellor announced that the Scheme would not close in 2014 but would remain open until 2015 in order to give people the maximum opportunity to claim their payments. The Treasury and the Scheme continue to work closely together to consider the most effective and efficient ways to trace and pay as many as possible of the remaining policyholders due a payment. 

The project end date shown is subject to Ministerial decision but is included for administrative purposes.
","Adelphi is the Home Office’s name for its Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and Shared Service Centre. The Home Office currently uses a version of the system for which, as of March 2015, Oracle support is due to cease. Therefore it is proposed that the Home Office move to a supplier who can provide both an updated ERP i.e. Oracle Release 12, and a common shared service model to provide transactional human resource, finance (including payroll) and procurement  services, in full alignment with the Cabinet Office Next Generation Shared Service strategic plan and the approved approach of the Crown Oversight Function based within the Cabinet Office.
 
This will effectively upgrade the current Adelphi system and transactional processes whilst offering benefits in terms of cash savings through economies of scale and improved user experience. 

","In a world of internet enabled communication, ensure that the police, wider law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies can lawfully obtain, manage and use communications data and intercepted content to: detect, prevent and disrupt crime; protect the public and save lives.","The Programme was launched to deliver a new generation of Border Security Systems including replacing the Warnings Index (WI) and Semaphore (S4). The primary benefits of delivering Digital Services at the Border (DSAB) are to: enhance the security of the UK; gather and act on data from those people and entities crossing the border, both inbound and out; and provide timely and accurate data to those who need to access/use it.
","The  Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Programme is delivering a new modernisation release for Barring and Disclosure that will unify and improve the operational service, with the introduction of electronic applications and referrals, the provision of a full strategic solution for the Update Service including for Northern Ireland, and enabling new services such as Barred List Checks. 

The benefits to be delivered include:
• A single integrated DBS Case Record Management (CRM) system that will provide enhanced workflow and automation.
• Common ways of working across the business.
• More efficient and effective information sharing across the business and with our delivery partners and stakeholders.
• Support for the ‘Digital by Default’ Government agenda, reducing manual and offline processes.
• Implementation of an efficient, Paperless Office.
• Reduction in the Cost of Operations.","The police, fire and ambulance Emergency Services (3ES) in England, Scotland and Wales use a common radio system called Airwave for critical voice and narrowband data , and use commercial networks for broadband data communications.  As Airwave contracts begin to expire, the Programme will replace the current arrangement with an integrated voice and broadband data service based on an enhanced commercial mobile network called the Emergency Services Network (ESN).

ESN will provide public safety functionality, coverage, availability and security but not necessarily in the same way as Airwave.

ESN strategic objectives are:
• Meeting Requirements (Better)
• Improved Flexibility (Smarter)
• More Affordable (Cheaper)
","To continue to provide secure accommodation for detained persons and reduce costs by amalgamating contracts at Colnbrook and Harmondsworth ensuring any change of  contractor is mobilised effectively prior to the expiry of the  existing contract on 31 August 2014.

","The main IT supply contracts for the Home Office expire in 2016. The main objective of the programme is to replace the existing IT service provision for the core Home Office whilst:

• maximising the flexibility and agility of our IT provision
• minimising the impact of the change on the business
• innovating and making use of technology and process enhancements
• ensuring service levels are maintained or improved upon (only reduced where conscious and evidenced cost saving decision is made)
• minimising the costs of change (transition).","Schengen Information Systems 2 (SIS II) exchanges information on persons and objects wanted for law enforcement purposes. It enables the participating Member States to better combat domestic and transnational crime, protect the border and strengthen public protection. It also extends the reach of law enforcement across Europe through enhanced information sharing and increased operational effectiveness. ","The Project is designed to improve customer service and reduce cost of operations; replace outdated infrastructure for increased resilience; and to replace the existing passport application management system with a new system for processing passport applications, to minimise support cost, both of which support the ability to issue passports reliably. The new system for processing passport applications is called Application Management System (AMS). 

","The A400M Programme is a multinational European collaboration to design, develop and deliver a brand new military transport aircraft. The A400M will provide a worldwide medium lift, Tactical Air Transport (Tac AT) designed to meet the requirements of Defence policy; as such, it will ultimately replace the UK’s current C-130J Hercules fleet. The scope of the UK elements of the Programme comprises: delivery of 22 A400M aircraft; a UK In-Service Support Solution; and a UK training solution for aircrew and ground personnel.","AIRSEEKER will sustain the UK's airborne electronic surveillance capability previously provided by the Nimrod R1 aircraft against an evolving and increasingly complex target set up to 2025. It will provide a rapidly deployable capability to support operations where it will be able to collect, analyse, fuse and disseminate a coherent and readily interpretable electronic surveillance picture in support of national, joint and coalition operations. This information will support targeting and combat identification. The period between retirement of the Nimrod R1 and introduction of AIRSEEKER is being covered through the UK/US Co-manning Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).","The overall aim of the Army 2020 Programme is to transform the British Army by the end of the decade in accordance with the structural design and operational concepts devised by the Army 2020 Study Team and endorsed by the Defence Board, to meet Defence Planning Assumptions and unforeseen challenges in the future strategic environment. The Programme sets out a whole force concept where regulars, reserves and civilians create an integrated capability that adds up to more than the sum of the parts. Extensive changes are made to the Army's structure, creating a Reaction Force and a pool of Adaptable Forces, supported by Force Troops. The number of Regular posts within the structure will fall from a post-SDSR endorsed total of c.94,000 to c.82,000 by 2016. The number of Reserves rises to c.30,000 to create an Army numbering c.112,000. Wider changes will be made to the Army's procedures, behaviours and culture by 2020 to ensure the effectiveness and long-term viability of the new model (the Transformation Agenda).","The aims and scope of the programme were set out in the Ministerial announcement of March 2013. The programme is to coordinate and deliver infrastructure, and non-infrastructure requirements to realise the capability and financial benefits: enable the A2020 organisational structure and UK laydown to be achieved, withdrawing the Army from Germany and delivering reduced costs.","The scope of the programme covers the design, development and manufacture of  7 Astute class submarines as detailed in the formal Staff Requirement of 1997.  The military requirement for up to 8 submarines was re-endorsed in the SDSR 10 which require the submarines to perform a wide range of military tasks; demonstrate global reach, endurance, covertness, sustained high speed and the ability to conduct unsupported operations in hostile environments.","To examine and implement the most effective way of closing Rhine Garrison and Munster Station in Germany by:

There has also been an increase in the capacity and capability in the Finance function.","A growth plan for loans was agreed to address the risk of underspend in the budget.  The key activity of the growth plan was to expand the provider base, inviting expressions of interest in having a loans facility and explaining the requirements that would need to be met.  This brought new providers into the loans system.  The inclusion of key words around 'funding advice' in the National Careers Service national campaign in summer 2014 led to an increase in the number of people viewing the 24+ Advanced Learning Loans page on the National Careers Service.  We know from our evaluation that loans are understood and learners are happy to take them on.  However, wider changes in the Further Education sector may be impacting on the take-up of 24+ Advanced Learning Loans.",Work is on-going to inform Government’s decision on a potential first sale from the loan book but there are no plans for a sale in this Parliament.,The sale of HMG's stake in Urenco has material risks which ultimately lie outside the control of HMG. A/R RAG remains appropriate based on the key project risks that remain and the volume of work yet to be completed.,"Following a review of the programme the Board approved a re-set. Action was initiated to revise the Roadmap, Business Case and benefits realisation plan.  Governance has been reshaped.","The numerous workstrands continue including the Crossrail 2 planning, the marketing of surplus sites, the due diligence and planning for legal launch.","Individual Electoral Registration (IER) went live on schedule in England and Wales in June 2014 and in Scotland in September 2014.  The IER Digital Service is performing extremely well and 87% of existing electors were confirmed on the new Register without having to take any action.  In excess of 9 million applications to register to vote were received prior to the 2015 General Election registration deadline, and 77% of these were online.  An IER Support Centre has been established to manage and support the IER live service, and training, help and advice have been provided to Local Authorities as necessary.  The programme is now focussed on (i) the realisation of operational efficiencies and opportunities for maximising the completeness and accuracy of the Register, and (ii) planning for a controlled and effective transition to business as usual. ","The NCS Trust is now operational and has delivered the 2013 autumn programme and all of the 2014 programme. The NCS Trust and Cabinet Office are now focusing on the delivery of the 2015 programme, working with NCS providers to ensure that the programme continues to grow and provide strong outcomes. In order to support the continued expansion of the programme the NCS Trust have completed a procurement exercise to bring in new NCS providers to deliver the programme from autumn 2015 ","1. The NCSP 2014 Health check has now concluded and recommendations from that are being used to inform the Business Case process for Financial Year (FY) 15/16. As part of this round of Business Cases, delivery partners have been advised to consider the two scenarios post March 2016 when the NCSP is due to finish: what plans do they have in place if no further Programme is created and what plans do they have if there is another Programme (what further transformational work would they look to do).
2.  The Health check also baselined where the Programme currently is, and work is underway to gather evidence for SDSR (as per Business Case scenario work above).
3. We have also created a new 'risk champion' within the Programme Team and have been working with delivery partners to improve risk reporting both in this FY and next FY.","•   The new alpha pension scheme went 'live' on 01/04/15. The new legislation took effect and business processes and IT changes were ready to manage members' benefits under the new Civil Service Pensions arrangements. The focus is now on embedding the changes into 'Business as Usual'.                                                                •   All key Communications have been issued, including guidance for employers to support them through the changes.

 ","ISSC1: Service performance has continued to deliver in line with the Service Level Agreement (SLA)/ Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) with a very low percentage of service failures. Customer departments remain satisfied with overall stable Business As Usual (BAU) operation of the contract, and as of December 2014, performance reports for SAP and Aggressor are provided to the framework and customer departments. The migration phase of the programme has experienced delivery date replans, however following a period of hibernation to allow arvato to focus on the successful migration of Maritime Coastguard Agency (MCA), customer departments are working with the Framework Authority and arvato to agree revised migration dates. Joint planning sessions have been arranged in January and February, for customer departments to discuss the planning timetable with a view to contractualising the revised migration dates. 

ISSC2 : BAU service performance has continued to deliver in line with the SLA/KPI's with a very low percentage of few service failures and MoJ and HO service is running well. Customer departments remain satisfied with overall operation of the contract. The Transformation phase of the programme has experienced schedule changes to the move of customers onto the new Single Operating Platform. Revised plans have been produced with new go-live dates for the IT delivery for EA and Defra. HO transformation plans have been produced and MoJ transformation plans are to follow at the end of January.2","The CPS have had a Gateway review since the Q2 GMPP report. Out of this review there were 7 actions assigned the CPS, 4 of which have been completed with the other three being ongoing pieces of work to develop the in-house SIAM capability of the CPS.","As at Quarter 2, the programme was pending the reassessment of programme delivery following the January 2014 MPA Gate 0 review report. 

The aim of no zone without development by 2015 has been achieved. Zones reported that by end September 2014 12,500 new jobs were created and over 400 new companies were now based in zones and that there had been over £2 billion of private sector investment. 

End of December 2014 returns from zones show that over 15,500 new jobs will have been created. This milestone demonstrates the significant progress that zones have made during 2014 supported by central funding opportunities, increased brand awareness, an Her Majesty Government (HMG) wide approach and enhanced programme management  processes. 

Improvements to Portfolio Management Office processes since the MPA Review include implementation of strengthened governance, risk management, stakeholder engagement, benefits realisation planning and financial monitoring. Work to quality assure the data collected from the Zones continues.

The Building Foundations for Growth (BFG) capital grant funding programme progresses well and is on target to support zones with £120m by the end March 2015, making a real impact on the development journey of 16 zones across the country. On the EZ commercial support package; Local Partnerships and land & property consultants, DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Ltd and GVA Grimley Ltd continue to provide expert advice to EZs; with the final few pieces of work due for completion by March 2015.
","As at Quarter 2  there were some key challenging transition points that needed carefully managing to ensure no hiatus or errors.  There was a long transition and implementation period to programme completion, during which changes to public bodies and local services continue posing new challenges for audit and value for money. A number of statutory instruments are already in force and further regulations and orders are in the process of being implemented by the time Parliament is dissolved in March to enable the new framework to be in place from 1 April 2015.  Audit firms and sector bodies are already well engaged in work required of them from 2017 when current contracts end and new regime begins; comms activity will continue in meantime. Research work on benefits realisation as been initiated. 

Staff and asset transfer schemes are now in advanced state of preparation together with remaining secondary legislation required to ensure that transitional body is ready to take on contracts and other bodies to pick up their functions once the Commission is closed by 31/03/15.  Transition Body Public Sector Audit Appointments (PSAA) is in place and making arrangements for smooth transition of contracts, staff and information assets. Monthly Delivery Boards continue to give oversight of the totality of policy, legislative and structural changes.

An interim internal review of domestic performance was undertaken and identified activities and investigations to further improve performance, which are being implemented.  The response to increased tariff levels for some non-domestic technologies is being monitored.  Further regulations to improve both schemes were laid in Parliament in December 2014.","A MPA Gate 0 Review in June 2014 reflected the good progress made since the last Gate Review in 2013, but acknowledged that there remained a number of areas requiring close management attention by the DECC programme team.

The Programme needs to continue to work closely with multiple cross-industry delivery partners to ensure Programme success. There is limited contingency in the plan up until live operations of the Data and Communications Company and the critical path activities remain demanding.
","The Amber/Red rating reflects the inherent high level of risk due to the nature of this digital exemplar programme, coupled with a review of the programme delivery approach by the Senior Responsible Owner (in Summer 2014).  A new SRO was appointed (October 2014)  and additional senior and specialist resource from the Government Digital Service was brought in to enhance the application of the Agile delivery model used by the programme. The scope and timelines for deliverables were thoroughly reviewed to better align with business needs which mitigated some of the risk in delivery.   

However, at the beginning of 2015 the programme encountered significant challenges in delivering to time and quality some of the key IT functionality required for a fully Digital By Default service.   Launch of the Pillar 1 Basic Payments Scheme (BPS) in April 2015 using the online portal mapping capability was considered too high risk and a contingency plan was invoked to allow customers to submit their BPS claims in 2015 through a number of other channels after registering on the online service.  A similar approach is being developed for Pillar 2 Countryside Stewardship applications in 2015.
",The Green rating reflects considerable progress made on the project to conclude a successful procurement in advance of the original schedule and delivering savings for the taxpayer. The programme remains on track and is in the mobilisation phase.," The Amber/Red rating reflects the inherent risks in a project of this size and duration, and the risks associated with the Infrastructure Provider procurement and in particular external risks which could affect the schedule.   Since Q2 2014/15 the Preferred Bidders for the three Main Works contracts have been announced by Thames Water and good progress has been made with the procurement of the Infrastructure Provider which remains on track for construction to start in 2016.",No actions planned.,Since our last report the overall delivery confidence has improved as the Aggregator Funding Procurement Agreement has now been signed and are proceeding to programme.,"The recovery of the construction market has impacted the programme.  We are continually reviewing our market strategy.  We have identified a broader range of procurement options for the programme, one of these options being the use of the new EFA Regional Contractors Framework which was launched in July 2014.",A Gate 0 Review of the St Helena Airport Programme was undertaken in April 2014.  The Delivery Confidence was an improvement from the previous review.  The Programme Board has reviewed its approach to procurement and economic development; and the project team has implemented new procedures and documentation for issue management. ,Successful delivery is forecast with the constant monitoring of the key risks to delivery. All critical delivery areas have dedicated leaders and are resourced. A robust mitigation strategy has been developed to counter any legal challenge that might jeopardise works starting by the end of 2016. A risk management process is in place with an identified escalation process. The project underwent statutory pre-application public consultation which concluded in June 2014. A public consultation report is being produced outlining the results.,"Crossrail Ltd continue to forecast that Crossrail is on schedule to open on time, with services operating through the central tunnel from December 2018.
The Department continue to scrutinise project costs and schedule performance to ensure the project remains on track. The Department's Project Representative's analysis indicates that Crossrail Ltd is still on target to deliver the programme to budget.
On 18 July 2014, TfL announced MTR Corporation (Crossrail) Limited (MTR) as the winning bidder of the Crossrail Concessionaire competition. Operation of London Rail services on the Greater Anglia spur (Liverpool Street to Shenfield) in preparation for future Crossrail services which commenced from 31 May 2015.
The Surface works delivered by Network Rail are now 42% complete and tunnelling is now complete. (May 2015).","The High Speed 2 programme remains in a strong position and continues to make significant progress. 
On Resourcing:
There has been significant progress on building capability in the programme as we transition towards the delivery phase. We have made key appointments to senior roles at DfT and HS2 Ltd including:
• Simon Kirby, Chief Executive, HS2 Ltd – May 2014
• Alistair Kirk, Programme and Strategy Director, HS2 Ltd – September 2014
• Jonathan Crone, PMO Director, HS2 Ltd - January 2015
DfT and Network Rail and HS2 Ltd have each grown their project teams, bringing in the skills and capability required for the next phase of work.
On Phase 1 Hybrid Bill and timetable:
The hybrid Bill for Phase One (London-West Midlands) was deposited on time and achieved resounding support at its Second Reading in April 2014 with a majority of 452 to 41 demonstrating the strong cross party support for the scheme.  Good progress has been made in hearing petitions and, by March 2015, 344 petitioners had been heard by the Bill Committee and a further 99 petitioners had withdrawn or will not appear on account of agreed changes or assurances received from the Secretary of State, along with 22 who were denied standing by the Committee.  
The Secretary of State announced in Parliament that the working assumption was that the Hybrid Bill would achieve Royal Assent in late 2016. A carry-over motion was successfully passed that will allow the Bill’s work to be carried over into the next Parliament.  The target opening date for Phase 1 remains unchanged for 2026.
On governance and the transition to the next phase:
Governance arrangements have been developed to formalise tripartite working between DfT, HS2 Ltd and Network Rail.  Board structures have been reviewed and the new structures have been operating successfully for some months. 
A Development Agreement was signed by DfT and HS2 Ltd on 8 December 2014 formalising the relationship between DfT and HS2 Ltd in developing and delivering the HS2 railway and associated work.  A new client board, chaired by the SRO, has been put in place to manage the performance of HS2 Ltd against this Development Agreement.
The creation of an integrated Programme Management Office, under the responsibility of the new HS2 Ltd Programme & Strategy Director, is in hand. 
We are making good progress on preparations towards construction:   HS2 Ltd held two further supply chain conferences, in London on 17 October 2014 and in Manchester on 23 October 2014, to discuss the commercial opportunities with the supply chain and inform the procurement strategy and approach for the programme. 
Phase 2 (Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds)
On 27 October 2014 Sir David Higgins released his second report on HS2, ‘Rebalancing Britain’.  This confirming that the strategic goal for Phase Two linking Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds is right; the East Midlands and South Yorkshire stations are best for the regions and the existing network; a hub station at Crewe would serve the local region and the North West; Leeds station must match the city’s vision and its transport needs; and that work needs to continue on the best route for an East/West connection in the North (‘HS3’), how and when it could be constructed, and its cost. 
In response to Sir David’s report, the Government confirmed its commitment to the Y Network. The programme in now undertaking further work to consider the possibility of expediting the delivery of part of the Phase 2 route and the possibility of a hub station at Crewe.  The Government expects to take decisions on this during 2015.

","The sponsor team continue to scrutinise project costs, risks and schedule performance to ensure the project remains on track.

Depot, platform extension and gauge compatibility works continue. Newton Aycliffe and Stoke Gifford topped out. North Pole ready for use.
                                                                                         Since March 2015, 2 trains have been delivered from Japan and have commenced testing.

","The programme completed in 2012. The Department is working to develop the programmes and projects to deliver the infrastructure and train service changes, and will consider lessons learned for the next Periodic Review in 2018.
","Since the autumn, a new Prior Information Notice and an updated schedule for the programme have been published on the gov.uk website; two franchises have been awarded; programme vacancies have been significantly reduced. Further, we have reduced recruitment turn around time by agreeing a single Efficiency and Reform Group approval that delegates procurement, award and extension of advisor approvals to the programme Senior Responsible Owner. Significant progress has been made specifically, the role of a formal programme director has now be created and has been recruited into. Formal risk reporting processes are in place and detailed  bid evaluation plans have been produced for live projects.","The UK SARH Programme is progressing against the plan. Bristow continues to work towards the construction of new bases, the delivery of airframes and recruitment/training of personnel.  The first two bases, Inverness and Humberside, went live on the 1st of April and are fully operational. Operational delivery of the remaining bases remain on track and Bristow has, at the time of writing, taken delivery of seven of the larger airframe types ahead of schedule. Bristow has experienced challenges due to the late delivery of the smaller airframe type and, as a result, initiated a  contingency plan. Despite the late delivery of the smaller airframe type, the contingency plan, which formed part of Bristow’s bid, will ensure that a SAR capability will be in place as each base goes live. ","The overall Programme schedule had been delayed due to issues identified during user testing of the system. However, since September 2014 good progress has been made, following an updated delivery plan introduced in August 2014. 
o The plan now focuses on moving a single business unit during the initial phase, rather than multiple migrations;
o The introduction of more detailed contractualised arrangements for specification and delivery tracking of key products; and 
o improved task monitoring arrangements. 
There will be further refinement of the client migration model to minimise complications associated to later phases of the overall programme.
",The Department monitors the progress of delivery and budget on all elements of the Thameslink programme on a regular basis through various regular meetings with key delivery partners.  Delivery of rolling stock is proceeding ahead of schedule with first train due to enter passenger service early in 2016. Three Bridges depot is on schedule to open in the summer. The Thameslink Southern Great Northern (TSGN) franchisee (GTR) is now in place and the franchise commenced in September 2014. Major infrastructure works at London Bridge were completed by NR on January 4th and the new South-eastern timetable started on 12 January 2015. Issues regarding train service reliability from London Bridge (Southern services) as a result of the infrastructure changes are being actively managed by industry working closely with the Department with a new passenger services timetable introduced in May 2015 on Southern and Thameslink routes.,"The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Red at Q2 2014.                                     
There were major risks and issues that are apparent in a number of areas around plan submittal and quality and aspirations around plans: 
1) The timescales set for local areas to submit plans which are of the required quality and aspiration are challenging which may lead to the number of plans that are 'not approved' being larger than what was hoped for by many stakeholders
2) The timescales during which the Task Force could provide support to areas was short therefore there was a risk that plans may not substantially change in quality from the previous submission
3) The local settings in which plans were being developed were complex with many and varied stakeholders (social care, local Government, NHS, HWBs, CCGs) and development of a robust and quality plan requires agreement across sectors
All of these issues and risks were actively managed and actions included:
• Plan improvement support over the summer for local areas included webinars, regional clinics, practical guides and intensive hands on support. 
• A Governance Structure to feed key decisions was set up and included regular meetings with the SoS Health, a X Ministerial Board and BCF Programme Board. 
• Three Checkpoints gave some visibility of area readiness to submit plans and the results were fed  into support arrangements, with any changes being made that were appropriate
• Five Fast Track areas submitted plans at the end of August and were ‘approved with support’ via the National Consistent Assurance Review process (NCAR).
• All remaining BCF plans were submitted and went through the NCAR process, receiving approval statuses. 
• The Taskforce was extended to continue into Phase 2, running from the end of October to the end of March. The objectives for this phase were to plan and develop the detail for support offerings and assurance for local areas post NCAR results.
Progress to date:
Since Q2, all plans not fully approved in October have been resubmitted following the delivery of support to areas not fully approved: areas in the 'approved' and 'approved with support' categories were mainstreamed into NHS England and LG mechanisms to enable them to progress with implementation. Those areas in the 'approved with conditions’ and ‘not approved’ categories worked with a team of Better Care Advisors and experts from a PA-led consortium to support them to strengthen their plans, break through issues and resubmit plans.
As of 26th January 2015, of 150 plans: 120 have been fully ‘Approved’; 4 are categorised as ‘Approved with Support’; the remaining 26 plans have been resubmitted and are currently undergoing the Nationally Consistent Assurance Process with a formal outcome on the 6th February. An escalation process is in place for areas who fail to reach either ‘Approved’ or ‘Approved with Support’ categories in this final wave of resubmissions. 
A KMPG-led consortia of experts has been engaged to lead implementation support nationally, with support being led regionally by NHS England regional leads with local government colleagues.
The current Taskforce currently has no scope or remit post March 2015 but work is underway to develop plans for a core team, resourced jointly by NHS England, DCLG, DH and LGA, to continue supporting the success of the Better Care Fund centrally. 
","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Green at Q2 2014.

The Trust has undertaken, with its Programme Board, a RAG assessment of the ""Common Causes of Project Failure"" in relation to the progress of the project at Q2.  The Programme Board discussed this in detail and were clear about the RAG ratings which were provided for each category.  Once all the ratings were taken together, the overall assessment was Amber/Green:  many of the key points had been addressed in the preparation for FBC approval, based on the OBC approval which was granted in May 2014.  The key areas of higher risk/lower confidence rating related mainly to stakeholder engagement and support (given that the commissioner landscape has changed significantly since commissioners provided the original OBC support letters).  There has been extensive engagement with commissioners through a NHS England Area Team-led Commissioner Oversight Forum to ensure that commissioners are sufficiently engaged with, and involved in, the assumptions relating to activity and income which underpin the Business Case.  Since May 2014, the NHS Trust Development Authority has convened a National Programme Board and National Working Group which includes commissioners and approving bodies to ensure that all key stakeholders in the process are working together.","The MPA RAG rating was Green at Q2 2014.
The Delivery Confidence assessment was Green on the basis that this was an extremely well run project and successful delivery appeared highly likely.

There were three recommendations relating to: confirmation that conditions attached to the FBC had been satisfied; ensuring the planned additional resources were in place as quickly as possible; and, conducting a detailed review of service and technical commissioning plans following appointment of the contractor.

The next Gateway review is Gate 4 (Readiness for Service) scheduled for November 2016, approximately six months before the patient moves in May/June 2017.","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Red at Q2 2014.
While the programme has a strong record in deploying/upgrading IT systems, there was concern about the early stage of planning for the migration of NHS Trusts to new locally sourced and managed services before the end of the BT Local Service Provider contract. 

Significant progress towards improved delivery confidence has been made in completing the remaining deploying activity and planning for contract exit:
• The programme team has refocused on Exit and is working closely with all NHS Trusts and Suppliers to support transition plans for migrating away from BT Local Service Provider services and to identify and manage associated risks;
• There is a better understanding of the requirements for contract exit with one NHS Acute Trust and three NHS Community and Mental Health Trusts having successfully exited the BT Local Service Provider service; 
• All NHS Community and Mental Health IT deployments and upgrades have been delivered; and
• All NHS Acute Trust IT deployments have been delivered with the remaining handful of upgrades forecast to be delivered on time.

Note: The BT Local Service Provider (London) Programme and the BT Local Service Provider (South) Programme operate through a single Programme Board have been assessed by the Cabinet Office's Major Projects Authority as a joint assessment.","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Red at Q2 2014.

In February 2014, NHS England announced a six month extension to the proposed roll out of the care.data programme in order to raise awareness, listen and act on the views of patients, health professionals and key stakeholders, and to discuss both the benefits and risks involved. This enabled time to be taken to raise awareness of the benefits of data sharing for purposes beyond direct care and the safeguards in place to secure patient data and to ensure the public are aware of their choices and are informed on how they can ‘opt out’ of care.data should they wish to do so. The outcome of the engagement was the message that clarity was required about how personal information would be used, what information would be collected and how patients would be communicated to on their right to ‘opt out’.  Additionally, it was clear that consideration should be given to the support required by GP practices to meet the fair processing requirements and successfully communicate these messages to support the introduction of care.data, and to implement care.data through a phased roll-out. The first stage of this phased roll out will take the form of a discovery stage working with up to 250 pathfinder GP practices. This approach will allow NHS England and the Health and Social Care Information Centre to work with a smaller number of GP practices to ensure that the programme understands what is required to support GP practices in meeting fair processing responsibilities and ensure patients are aware of how their data will be used and the choices available to them - this is referred to as the pathfinder stage. The ‘pathfinder stage’ has been established as a project within the care.data programme, it will provide key information from which the programme team can learn and assess the impact before progression into a wider roll-out. No data will be extracted from GP practice systems – including during the ‘pathfinder’ until such time that the national data guardian is satisfied.

The Cabinet Office's Major Projects Authority rated delivery confidence as Red in view of the Programme needing to clarify, agree and communicate the programme scope; appoint a full-time Senior Responsible Owner; reconstitute the Programme Board with a clear role and responsibilities; approve explicit go/no go criteria; agree and clarify finances; assign owners to key risks; and recruit key personnel.
Action taken by the Programme includes changing the Programme Board membership with a clear role, responsibilities and Terms of Reference; scheduled meetings at clear decision points in the programme; Programme Board approved explicit go/no go criteria to ensure that delivery plans are viable before the pilot rollout commences; and priority given to the recruitment of key personnel in order to move forward to a more controlled and stable phase of delivery. 

Care.data plan to achieve the following in order to move towards an improved rating for the programme:
• Complete the Programme Business Case assurance and approval process;
• Complete the pathfinder stage of the first phase of the programme and secure approval to proceed to further roll-out;
• Plan national roll out of the primary care extract to deliver primary-secondary care linked dataset, including development of an outline business case;
• Determine priority datasets for inclusion in the programme and initiate appropriate workstreams; and
• Further enhance programme planning and risk management to ensure dependencies on other national programmes are well understood and managed.","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Red at Q2 2014.
Because of the complexity of the Programme and the indirect nature of the delivery mechanisms, as well as the separate and inherent risks to local government arising from fiscal constraint, the Delivery Confidence at this point remains as: Amber/Red. The recent rating reflects strong support and commitment across the system, but also the residual challenges to local authorities and risk profile.  The Amber/Red rating reflects greater complexity, uncertainty and the risk of diversion during 2015.
The Programme has made good progress and 2015/16 delivery is now more secure.  The Care Bill achieved Royal Ascent in May 2014 becoming the Care Act 2014, regulations and guidance underpinning the reforms that come into effect in April 2015 were published in October 2014, including agreement of the funding for local government of the new burdens from the changes. The tripartite partnership between DH, LGA and ADASS at the heart of the programme continues to be a strong one and a major asset to the Programme. The partnership with the LGA and ADASS ensures shared ownership and implementation of a programme management approach to assure delivery.  An assurance and implementation support strategy has been agreed that combines oversight, monitoring and assessment at all levels with a commitment to target resources appropriately to tackle risk.  Steps we have taken to address the risk to date risk include the provision of £19m direct to local authorities to build programme management capacity and support engagement in assurance,  with £4m of funding for local authorities in addition to £2.7m provided to establish nine regional delivery partnerships to support local implementation.  We have also made a significant investment in a range of implementation support products that support local authorities and providers to prepare their workforce for the changes and assist communication.

Good progress has been made with implementation of an action plan to address MPA recommendations, as well as in delivering the Programme Plan.  Programme Management  has been strengthened and lessons from Phase 1 are being applied to reduce risk to delivery for Phase 2.  Improvements in the transition from policy development to implementation have been identified and are being applied to Phase 2.  We recognise the risk that the uncertainty caused by the election and Spending Review may undermine efforts to deliver Phase 2, however we are confident that we are developing plans and contingency options to do everything within our control to manage this uncertainty and encourage preparations to allow implementation Phase 2.

The review resulted in an Amber rating and a set of recommendations relating to readiness for the 2014/15 flu season. The recommendations highlighted that planning, structures and communications needed to be strengthened. An action plan has been produced which details the progress that has been made against the recommendations.  Apart from one recommendation they have all been completed. The outstanding recommendation will be completed before the May 2015 deadline set by the MPA.  Planning for the 2015/16 flu season started in October 2014 and communications will be available far earlier than in previous years.","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Red at Q2 2014.
The project is assessed Amber / Red due to the challenge and complexity involved in exiting the CSC Local Service Provider contract by July 2016 . The key actions being taken to reduce the risk to contract exit and drive up delivery confidence include development of a clear “paths to exit” for each organisation and deployed system including engagement between suppliers and organisations; support to put in place procurement frameworks for replacement systems; facilitating the early exit from contract; early transition of the Local Service Provider GP estate to the GP Systems of Choice Framework; and agreeing exist support arrangements with the supplier.

Risk remains in enacting the activities involved as it requires the support and active involvement from all NHS organisations and future suppliers.","The MPA RAG rating was Red at Q2 2014.
Recent positive developments on patient safety, involving key national bodies and local providers, make  timely a review of proposals to introduce medical examiners.   For example, NHS England, the Care Quality Commission, the NHS Litigation Authority, Monitor, and the NHS Trust Development Authority are providing a system wide support to local providers who have signed up to the campaign Sign up to Safety, with the ambition of halving avoidable harm in the NHS over the next three years and saving 6,000 lives as a result.

The rated delivery confidence is Amber in view of the Programme needing to:
• Focus on strategic risks and issues;
• Restrict its Board membership;
• Establish a Service Manager for the end to end patient experience;
• Undertake a risk assessment;
• Delineates deployment from business as usual;
• Ensure an effective contract management process;
• Resolve the controlled drugs and nomination issue; and
• Appoint a Business Change manager.

The move to Phase 4 has been delayed from April 2015  to allow time to undertake a number of key activities to improve delivery confidence. These are to ensure robust business continuity arrangements are in place, implement a more formal arrangement with dispensing system suppliers, a full review of the service model, more robust patient communications, implementation of schedule 2 & 3 controlled drugs, and consideration of providing refresher training to dispensers. A review of the Programme Board structure and other governance arrangements will also be completed.  

The most significant risk remains the outcome of the Home Office / Department of Health's three month public consultation to determine whether Schedule 2 & 3  Controlled Drugs should be brought into scope. The outcome could lead to a requirement for further technical changes.

The programme will exceed 2014/15 business case target for GP roll out with a forecasted 51% of GP sites live by the end of the year (the Business Case target was 43%).  Utilisation, based on total sites deployed, is forecasted  to end the year at 40% (the Business Case target was 42%).  Almost 97% of pharmacies have been deployed (the Business Case target was 96%) and the team continue to work with all eligible pharmacies to increase take up.  66% of Dispensing Appliance Contractors have been deployed (the Business Case target was 99%) with 88% expected to go live by the end of 2014/15. 
 
Further progress has been made in a number of important areas including dispensing system supplier contracts,  filling vacancies in the Programme team and refresher training for pharmacy staff.","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Red at Q2 2014.
A system of assurance is in place with wider scrutiny of RAG ratings and milestones.  This includes a regular agenda item on both the monthly Francis Assurance Board (FAB) and weekly Secretary of State Care Meeting with ALBs. 

Health Check review: Independent assurance to provide an assessment of the impact of the Francis Initiative to date and recommendations for improvement going forward. This is scheduled for the last week of January 2015.

Work is now focusing on the three separate workstreams led by the Quality Improvement Team.  These are:

•       Safety – delivery of the SofS's March announcements for patient safety and Hard Truths commitments such as the Sign up to Safety Campaign, Patient Safety Collaborative programme, as well as 
          supporting a longer-term policy framework ensuring alignment of safety policy and initiatives.
•       Quality – developing a longer-term policy framework for quality improvement as part of the Strategic Work Plan.
•       Francis Assurance – assuring progress against Hard Truths commitments, particularly focused on delivering a One Year On report on 12th February 2015.   ","The MPA RAG rating was Amber at Q2 2014.
Specific points contributing to the Amber Delivery Confidence assessment will need to be addressed to achieve a green delivery confidence. These are:

Late delivery of Patient Facing Services and other new subsidiary modules under General Practice System of Choice which is likely to reduce the benefit delivered under the framework in 2014/15;

A key objective of the new framework was to open up the market to smaller, subsidiary suppliers but the introduction of new services was delayed due to deficiencies in suppliers' offerings and a lack of HSCIC capacity to perform assurance activity and requirements definition; and

Authority assurance activity for supplier services is being streamlined and requirements are being re-prioritised as mitigation against further delay. The Authority will shortly be revising the contract to reflect the new priorities and target dates for delivery. Suppliers are in the process of responding to ascertain what Principal and Subsidiary offerings (including global switch on) can be achieved by March 2015.

All critical actions were completed after the Gate 4 review in September 2014. 3 essential actions are in progress, 2 of which require Programme Board sign off before they can be closed, which related to the refreshed vision for the service and levers to achieve it.  The final action will be closed in March-15, which relates to capacity and capability of the team, with recruitment and other activities underway to close the previously identified gaps.

The MPA rating reflects the inherent risk in a project such as this but recommendations have been made to further assure the successful delivery of the ‘main phase’ of the programme which begins in 2015. Delivery partners are working together to refine the models that will be used for collecting data from the NHS Genomic Medicine Centres across the country.  A cross-partner advisory group for communications has been established to ensure consistent messaging across the programme.

The following actions are in place to ensure all is being done to deliver on the programme’s service transformation and workforce expansion aims, and to safely deliver the transfer of commissioning responsibilities for 0-5s public health services to Local Authorities on 1 October 2015:

• Ensuring that those who start their health visitor training go on to become health visitors.
• Reducing the number of health visitors leaving the workforce.
• Maximising the FTE contribution to the workforce of newly trained health visitors.
• Ensuring all relevant health visitors are counted properly towards the 4,200 FTE objective.
• Putting a full programme board in place consisting of members from all key stakeholder groups to oversee delivery of, and manage risks to, the safe transfer of commissioning responsibilities for 0-5s public health services to Local Authorities on 1 October 2015.
• Publishing Local Authority financial allocations through the Baseline Agreement Exercise.
• Publishing draft regulations on mandated universal health visitor reviews.

 At the last review MPA found that considerable progress had been made and noted a number of key developments.  These included approval by HMT of the OBC and subsequent ministerial announcement about the programme in January 2014, successful achievement of the key milestones to establish the pilots, developing the data strategy and smooth transition of the programme team from DH to NHS England. There was noted to be visibly stronger commitment at all levels to the programme which was assessed to be in good shape, and the review team sensed that the team was much better placed to successfully deliver the policy goals.  Despite the significant degree of challenge and complexity associated with this programme, the review team found that all recommendations from the previous review had been addressed. It was recognised that more work is still required, particularly regarding ICT, workforce planning, communications and stakeholder engagement to ensure that these areas do not negatively impact the chances for successful delivery.  The AAP Review Team noted that if active management attention was paid to them, there was no reason why the delivery confidence rating should not continue to improve further.
In response to recommendations an ICT and data strategy has been produced, and detailed ICT and data requirements are in the process of being developed with the Health and Social Care Information Centre; a workforce planning project has been initiated with Health Education England to validate workforce assumptions, and to address skills and workforce supply issues;  communications and stakeholder engagement have been strengthened with the production of a series of films focusing on service user experiences, which is published on the NHS England website; service user focus groups and a service user committee have also been put in place. A further  review is planned, to assess the team's readiness to develop and present a Full Business Case (FBC) to HM Treasury later in the year. A Gateway 3 review is planned for August 2015 to assess the FBC immediately prior to its submission to HM Treasury.","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Green at Q2 2014.

A detailed Management Action Plan was developed in consultation with the key Programme stakeholders which identified specific actions to be taken to address the findings from the MPA.  Due to the complexity and unique nature of the Programme, targeted actions were implemented leading to: 
1. Changes in the leadership and governance arrangements for the Programme to enhance the overall robustness by supporting the delivery and effective management of the current phase which largely involves procurement of the equipment, assurance and securing the necessary Government approvals. 
2. A revamp of the Programme environment providing clarity to where accountability and responsibilities lies at the various tiers of the National Programme, for example: 
A. DH is providing leadership and responsible for:
i. Capital Funding
ii. Programme management and delivery
iii. Approvals and assurance using mandatory Cabinet Office and HM Treasury processes.  
B. NHS England is providing leadership and responsible for:
i. Commissioning
ii. Clinical Services and Referrals
iii. Mobilisation of PBT Services
iv. Clinical Policy development
v. Benefits Management and Realisation
vi. Engagement with key stakeholders including the Devolved Nations and professional organisations
vii. Research and Development. 
3. Improvements in the resource levels including confirmation of the core Programme team and use of subject matter experts in specific areas such as the role of a National Clinical Lead for PBT, Workforce Strategy and Development, and Communications.
4. Structured and coordinated stakeholder engagement – in particular, the establishment of a National PBT Special Interest Group (SIG) with the active participation of the relevant Clinical Reference Groups (CRGs); Health Education England (HEE); professional organisations such as The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR), The Society and College of Radiographers (SCoR), Institute for Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM). In addition, the Programme also has access to the expertise of specialists in the related fields relevant to developing a national PBT service in England. 
Work has been done to develop a national plan for the clinical management of patients who have been clinically assessed to benefit from PBT treatment. Part of this work involves the review and expansion of the clinical indications list via NHS England processes through the development of clinical policies by engaging with the relevant CRGs as a longer term strategy for the viability of a National PBT service.  The culmination of these actions has put the Programme on a much improved pedestal in terms of governance, resources, communications, stakeholder engagement and the plans towards the delivery of sustainable benefits.

The key issues for the NHS Choices programme are:
- splitting the transformation programme from the running of the live service (the minimum viable service);
- leadership of the programme and establishing a permanent Senior Responsible Owner; and
- future direction and funding for the service.

Therefore the NHS Choices programme pathway to a green delivery confidence includes:
- review of the current programme management and governance arrangements;
- appointment of a permanent Senior Responsible Owner for the programme;
- the business justification for funding of the live service for 2015/16 and initial funding of the transformation programme to be approved; and
- a programme business case for 3 years (with option to extend by 2 further years) to be submitted for approval.","The MPA RAG rating was Amber at Q2 2014.
The rating reflects the high risk and complex nature of the programme, as well as the high level of issues related to the NHS e-Referral Service software that still required resolution prior to implementation. The NHS e-Referral Service was not ready for go live at the time of the review; and there was an Amber status regarding achieving the previously announced target go live date of November 2014.

A number of actions were underway at the time of the review, which included:
•         Updating the project plan to deliver NHS e-Referral Service, including ensuring a consolidated critical path (the minimum set of activities and associated durations to complete) was in place to support key decision points;
•         A revised test plan, to ensure all necessary testing (such as testing the service works, quickly, is secure, etc.) of the service is completed in advance of go live; and
•         Working with senior users, the Senior Responsible Owner and the Programme Board for the service to agree the quality criteria for acceptance of the new system, and agreement reached to de-prioritise any non essential items for go live.

All MPA critical actions were completed, 3 essential actions are in progress, 2 of which require Programme Board sign off before they can be closed, which related to the refreshed vision for the service and levers to achieve it.  The final action will be closed in March-15, which relates to capacity and capability of the team, with recruitment and other activities underway to close the previously identified gaps.

The path to green for NHS e-Referral Service is focussed on completing go live expediently and safely.  This involves reducing issues with the software, completing test, data migration and service readiness (so the service is supported after go live) activity.

Although the project was progressing as fast as possible, it was unlikely to be completed within the scheduled timescale (July 2016) primarily due to business case approvals timescales required and the need to undertake a GDS recommended discovery phase activity ahead of the production of the SOC. In addition an MPA recommended  independent risk review by Mazars LLP concluded that the proposed project schedule of July 2016 posed a significant  risk of distraction to the 2015 Scheme Implementation project, a view endorsed by key stakeholders within the NHSBSA, Cabinet Office and Department of Health and direction was given to:
• Extend the project schedule to July 2017, to mitigate any risk to the 2015 Scheme Implementation project.
• Change the future procurement approach to a disaggregated model in line with Cabinet Office guidance to:
     o Undertake further discovery work to identify options for a short term tactical solution to deal with the expiry of current EP Payroll Services in July 2016 (EP Interim 
         Extension), ahead of the production of the Interim Business Case (IBC)
     o Undertake further discovery work to identify options for a medium term strategic solution for the full pension re-procurement, ahead of the production of the
          Programme Business Case [PBC]. 

Even when the above are complete, both streams of procurement are likely to evolve as the final level of procurement options (disaggregation) become known.  As a result the project will continue to carry a high degree of risk, reflected in the RAG status.

The actions required to bring the RAG status back to green are:
• IBC approval (December 2014) and completion of commercial negotiations with EP to determine the level of disaggregation for the short term solution (March 2015).
• PBC approval (April 2015).
• Project re-Planning and re-base lining of Project Initiation Documentation (December 2014).","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Red at Q2 2014.

Since this return, the Trust has decided to pause the development work on the new hospital for the time being.  The Trust remains totally committed to developing a new hospital to meet the future needs of the people of Hartlepool, Stockton, Easington and Sedgefield. However, the Trust feels that the complexities of the approval process are such that the Trust will be unable to get a decision before the end of the current Parliament. It is anticipated that with a general election approaching in May 2015 the Trust believe it likely that all new developments will be reviewed in light of its own priorities. As a result, there inevitably will be further delay in the completion of the new hospital. The Trust has therefore decided to pause the development work on the new hospital. The project remains only affordable subject to a capital contribution from the Department of Health.

The delivery confidence assessment has been set at Green as rotavirus immunisation was successfully introduced on schedule on 1 July 2013. Vaccine uptake is in line with expectations at about 93% for one dose, and about 88% for the full course of two doses. The burden of rotavirus disease has reduced significantly following the introduction of the immunisation programme. Laboratory reports of confirmed instances of rotavirus for the period July 2013 to June 2014 were about 70% lower than the ten-season average for the same period in the seasons 2003/2004 to 2012/2013. This is an early indication, which needs to be confirmed by further investigation, that rotavirus immunisation is having an effect on the level of disease.

Following Financial Close in December 2013, construction commenced as planned in early February 2014. The construction programme has been delayed due to the discovery of asbestos on the site. However, the PFI Consortium has developed remedial measures and a revised programme shows a steady recovery of lost time so that the contractual completion date remains unchanged at March 2017.

The Trust confidence assessment was originally well founded as its OBC was agreed by the DH and HMT. It has subsequently had issues to resolve regarding affordability due to externally driven financial pressures e.g. tariff reviews and increasing Quality Innovation Productivity and Prevention (QIPP) demands. This led, in conjunction and agreement with the NHS Trust Development Authority (TDA), to the project being appropriately downsized to help mitigate the affordability position.","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Green at Q2 2014.
The RAG rating reflects the authorisation of the OBC by DH/HMT and a successful commencement of the procurement.

The programme achieved an Amber/Green rating due primarily to the lack of clear governance arrangements at that time.  In response to the recommendations the programme team have established a robust programme governance model and, as such, five of the six recommendations have now been closed.   The remaining recommendation, for Trusts to create clear benefits realisation plans, is currently being addressed by Trusts with support from the programme team, as they prepare their Full Business Cases and prepare for deployment.

The Amber assessment reflects a delivery confidence that Care Identity Service delivery in February 2015 appears feasible. As with all major deliveries of this scale there are a number of significant risks that are being managed to mitigate the impact to the programme.  Hence, our pathway to a Green assessment is based upon the following actions being underway:
• There have been a number of rehearsals, working closely with BT Health, to validate the approach to a complex transition;
• There has been considerable stakeholder engagement, the develop of a national e-learning tool and considerable Registration Authority training;
• The non-functional assurance (volumes and performance testing) is underway and is a significant element that must pass the technical assurance activities, this remains a significant risk until the assurance activities conclude in mid February; and
• A 24/7 end to end service and IT operational management capacity has been established and will adopt the current spine service 1st and 2nd line support mechanism.","The MPA RAG rating was Amber at Q2 2014.
There has been significant progress:
• As of January 2015 almost 50 million records have been created, over 86% of the population of England. 
• Use of Summary Care Record has increased with over 30,000 views of records per week (equating to one record viewed every 20 seconds) and rising.
• The ministerial commitment to enable a third of all A&Es, Ambulance Trusts and 111 with Summary Care Record has been successfully delivered.
• A total of 130 Community Pharmacies are live with Summary Care Record, with positive initial findings from the proof of concept exercise.
• First of Type testing for improved delivery of additional information within TPP SystmOne GP system (Summary Care Record v2.1) has commenced.
• The programme is current on track to achieve a Value for Money ratio of 3.86 (net present value), with additional benefits to be quantified.
• Summary Care Record is referenced in the National Information Board’s framework, recognising that the solution has further potential.

Actions taken to improve delivery confidence include:  The Programme has undertaken a stocktake to ensure that it structured in the optimal way for the next phase of delivery; the Senior Responsible Owner role has been reviewed and clarity provided to the Programme; a review of the Stakeholder Management process has been completed and improvements implemented;  the Programme has developed a more robust process for managing changes supported by an Expert Advisory Committee which has been established to provide lay input, governance and greater patient voice to Programme.

Remaining actions underway to progress the Programme towards a Green delivery confidence include: Plans and processes in development to move completed constituents parts of the programme into Business As Usual live service;  improvements to communication approach and marketing of Summary Care Record, involving  a digital media campaign, targeted messages at specific groups and increased patient engagement, underpinned by a Communications Plan; Programme Board members reviewed and new members co-opted as required to bolster expertise and governance.

","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Red at Q2 2014.
The Programme is progressing towards a positon where there will be confidence in going live by completing the required testing of the solution, progressing contracts for the support of the live service with suppliers to conclusion by mid-February and ensuring the required documentation and processes are in place prior to go-live through the use of Service Acceptance Criteria. These are the key areas where progress is required to enable the service to move into a live environment and the Programme Team is prioritising these actions to ensure go-live is achieved.

The MPA noted the improvement in the  quality and quantity of the resource available to the Programme. Work has also been undertaken over this period to strengthen the governance, planning and commercial aspects of the project. The Amber/Red rating was primarily due to the level of activity still required to enable the February go-live date to be achieved. In particular there was concern around the Service Contracts being completed in time to support the live system.

The two HIGH recommendations of the review relate to a critical path and to contingency arrangements. Work has been undertaken to enhance the programme plan following the revised go-live date, highlighting the revised critical path. In terms of contingency planning options have been reviewed to enable SUS to go-live in the absence of Care Identity Service system going live. Proposals on both these issues have been accepted by the Programme Board and will be key to increased delivery confidence. The two MEDIUM recommendations on programme board composition and on benefits planning are to be addressed in coming months, following transition go-live.
","Implementation has been successful to date. Over 5 million people automatically enrolled by December 2014 with an opt-out rate averaging less than 10 per cent. Rates of on-time compliance remain very high for those employers who have staged so far, and the Department successfully negotiated high staging volumes in Summer 2014. The Programme remains on course to complete implementation to timetable. 

The Programme’s focus now is to support the circa 1.3 million small and micro employers who begin staging from June 2015. The Department is refining the ways in which it has supported larger employers in order to meet the needs of smaller employers, and to this is:
• testing variants of its communications channels to identify the most effective means of engagement and of securing timely compliance; 
• helping payroll providers, advisers and intermediaries to fully support employers; and 
• working closely with pension scheme providers and other sectors to manage the capacity required to support the delivery of the programme. 

The MPA reviewed the Programme in December 2014 and supported the Department’s approach. The current rating balances the good progress so far and the scale of the challenges to come.
","Following the MPA review in May 2013 that considered the successful delivery of Phase 1, all recommendations were accepted and addressed by the Programme. 

Phase 1 of the Programme is now complete. This introduced the new IT system, a mandatory gateway to encourage family based arrangements and, where these arrangements cannot be made, an application to the statutory 2012 scheme.  

The MPA revisited the Programme in February 2014 and subsequently increased the delivery confidence rating for successful delivery of Phase 2. All recommendations from this review were accepted and addressed by the Programme. 

Phase 2, which went live between 30 June 2014 and 11 August 2014, introduced client charging and triggered the start of proactive historic case closure activity.
","An MPA review was completed in November 2014. The Delivery Confidence assessment reflects that: 
• All previous MPA review recommendations have been implemented.
• All Jobcentres were live with Day 1 Conditionality and Weekly Work Search Reviews and had achieved 50 per cent for Weekly Work Search Reviews by the end of October 2014. 
• All of the other measures (Quarterly Work Search, Increasing Lone Parent Conditionality and English Language Requirements – England only) were live from April 2014, with English Language Requirements going live in Scotland and Wales from 27 November 2014.   
","A revised business case has been developed which outlines the potential reduction in estates demand and the associated people impacts.  The Programme has also taken steps to ensure its work is aligned with other transformation programmes, during a period of unprecedented welfare reform.  Regional teams have been put in place and are responsible for exploring the potential future estates blueprint in each of 7 regions across the country.  ","As result of an MPA review, the Programme has reviewed its risk management process so that implementation related risks are discussed regularly, including at the Risk Review and Programme Boards.

The Programme, with the supplier, has ensured that there are robust integrated plans in place for the delivery of FfW which is monitored through regular checkpoint meetings and reviewed at Programme Board.

The Programme has established clear engagement strategies for General Practitioners, employers and employees; including clear responsibilities for each activity.  This is monitored through regular Communications Working Group meetings and through the Programme Plan.
","The Programme had an MPA review in November 2014. This recognised the good governance processes in place and the significant progress made by the Programme in the last year.

• All Jobcentres were live with all Help to Work measures by 31 December 2014.
• Management Information reports that have been produced have been tested and confirmed as fit for purpose.
• Robust contract management is in place.",The Programme has taken action against the nine recommendations the MPA made in October 2014 with seven of the nine recommendations having been cleared by February 2015. Recent confirmation of the Programme’s strategic direction will enable the outstanding actions relating to programme plans and dependencies to be resolved quickly. ,"An MPA Review in January 2015 made a number of recommendations that were accepted and are currently being addressed. The review acknowledged that:

• The Project has developed, in partnership with HMRC, an integrated IT plan that encompasses the full programme of pension changes.
• The Project is now fully constituted with appropriate governance and an experienced project team in place.  
• The Detailed Business Requirements have been defined and agreed ready to move into the build and test phase in readiness to deliver the IT changes in October 2015 to meet the April 2016 policy implementation date.
• The Project has implemented an integrated communication campaign to inform existing and future customers what to expect. A bespoke statement service has been set up for future customers, who are within 15 years of their state pension age to find out what they will get under the new rules. This service will subsequently be replaced by a new Digital Statement service which is currently being developed in parallel as a separate project and jointly with HMRC. 
","The Programme had an MPA review in November 2014 which recognised the significant improvements made since the previous review in May 2014.

Improvements to processes, IT and increased capacity have resulted in productivity increases and greater flexibility for Assessment Providers and the Department. These changes have resulted in a significant increase in clearance of applications to PIP, evident in  the statistics published in January 2015. 

The Programme continues to develop its approach for transforming and improving the PIP service, including the introduction of online services. 
","The Programme's delivery plan was announced in September 2014. At the same time HM Treasury agreed the Strategic Outline Business Case.  It set out an approach which reduced risk across the lifetime of the Programme. These plans were developed and agreed with delivery partners, including Local Authorities and HMRC.  The plans included:
• Continued expansion of the existing UC service to the whole of the North West by December 2014.
• Extension of this Live Service to include families by March 2015.
• Introduction of UC to single claimants nationally throughout 2015-16 .
• A controlled test of the UC Digital Service commencing on 26 November 2014 in a single postcode area testing UC for all claimant types
• Establishing a UC service across Great Britain by 2017 with the caseload continuing to build thereafter.
","The project continues to be run under the FCO approved IAAP process with regular governance meetings, risk and status reviews.","Although some progress has been made against the Gate 4 Action Plan, the suppliers' transition plans have been revised and are currently showing completion in late April 2015 (SMI) and July 2015 (DI). In addition, the FCO is currently seeking approval to embark on a major Technology Overhaul (TO) of its ICT infrastructure. The full impact of TO on the DI and SMI contracts is still to be confirmed pending completion of the TO business cases and associated approvals. ","Following the review, the Full Business Case was developed further as recommended and subsequently received approval from HM Treasury and Cabinet Office.  Further work has since been done on Benefits and Key Performance Indicators.  Government departments are continuing to work well together on implementation including sharing of best practice.","The project continues to be run under the FCO approved IAAP process with regular governance meetings, risk and status reviews.",Debt Management and Banking resources are being maintained within operational tolerances with key performance indicators showing strong delivery across the business.,"Two of our four digital exemplars, Your Tax Account and Digital Self-Assessment, moved into ‘public beta’ (opening  the service to the wider public whilst continuing to ask for feedback on how it can be improved) on 27th May 2014.

Pay As You Earn (PAYE) for Employees (formerly PAYE Online) is ready for public beta. Due to the dependency on the Government Digital Service IDA (Identity Assurance) for Citizens, PAYE will move into public beta mid October 2014.
","Debt Collection Agencies programme activity treated as business as usual by DMB.  The Debt Market Integrator go live has been delayed and as a result DMB will be looking at extending the Debt Collection Agencies contracts. We have reprofiled the 14/15 Work Programme that identifies debts that are suitable to place in the Debt Collection Agencies process. This takes into account the delayed start for the Debt Market Integrator, to ensure we fully utilise the private sector to maximise the capacity available in order to address the debt balance. We are working to reprofile the benefits and costs.",VAT Registration Transformation (VRT) the final delivery of the One Click programme has taken place. The One Click programme full business case will be finally updated following completion of work on the actions arising from the VRT project post implementation review. Work on formal closure of the VRT project and One Click programme are underway. ,"Results for the first part of 2014-15 have exceeded the forecast. The programme are seeking to establish the confidence levels in the year end forecast.

","Additional IT changes were successfully delivered in the Summer of 2014. 

A phased approach to the implementation of in-year late filing penalties from October 2014 was approved at the July Programme Board meeting.  In-year late filing penalties for large and medium employers will commence in October 2014 and small & micro employers will commence from March 2015. Activities to support this approach are progressing well. Activities are also on-going to support the implementation of in-year late payment penalties from April 2015.
","The main drivers for the RAG status are the challenging delivery timeline set alongside a legal challenge from voucher providers in the existing employer supported childcare scheme to the decision to appoint National Savings and Investment as the childcare account provider for Tax-Free Childcare.

","Benefits over the SR10 period are set to total £1,341.3m against a business case total of £1,310m.","The Green RAG status reflects the extension of the Scheme to 2015 and that the number of payment issued by the Scheme at the end of Q3 2014/15 has reached  91% for individual policyholders and 81% of group scheme policyholders and continues to slowly increase.    

 Building on the success of the advertising and further tracing work begun in Q3 2013/14, work has continued to try to find the remaining  c160,000  policyholders unpaid at the end of Q2.  Following a successful pilot of the Department for Work and Pension’s letter forwarding service, this has been rolled out where the Scheme holds a National Insurance number, date of birth and address. At  the end of Q3 2014/15,26,000 letters sent the DWP's bulk letter forwarding service had resulted in 9,318 payments.  Success rate monitoring will continue in coming months to ensure cost effectiveness is maintained in future tracing activity.

Progress has been made in reducing the number of the remaining,  most difficult to trace, unpaid policyholders   despite these efforts. Whilst payments will continue, it is expected that, despite these continuing efforts to trace them, c12.8% of the policyholder population will not be found.
",Escalation to Cabinet Office for Next Generation Shared Services  (NGSS) ISSC2 programme to provide revised plans which will validate the Adelphi go-live date and commercial impact.,Good progress has been made across the majority of delivery areas and we have made improvements in the flexibility and reliability of system capabilities.,"The October 2013 Border Systems Options Review recommended the creation of a new programme, called Digital Services at the Border, to replace current IT systems.  A new Programme Director is being recruited, along with a Portfolio Director to oversee the broader Border Systems Portfolio of which DSAB is part.",The project is undertaking additional assurance of the solution design to ensure that the solution will meet requirements and additional expertise has been introduced.,The Programme has completed all the recommendations raised from the Project Assessment Review & Major Projects Review Group Panels held during OBC approval in April/May 2014. ,The programme has successfully transitioned to business as usual.,"An action plan to address the review recommendations is in progress and reviewed by the programme board on a monthly basis.

The reasons for this rating are:
• Timescales for the programme are challenging, the Programme continues to work with suppliers to address and improve the speed of delivery. 
• This is the first large scale Agile programme delivered within the Home Office, new ways of working are being developed and the programme is refining the delivery approach with its suppliers. ",The NGOV project has transitioned to business as usual with effect from 1 October 2014. Transition has been successfully delivered in all locations unless the service has been suspended due to security issues. Any further decision to open in these locations will be managed through business as usual processes.                                                ,"The timescale pressure has been relieved by the identification of a ‘handover period’ with the incumbent suppliers contracts: however, the significant financial and solution / plan risks for the programme remain. The programme is working closely with Government Digital Service (GDS) to ensure the right level of disaggregation and is potentially looking to re-use GDS's solutions from their recent disaggregation.","Following the Project Assurance Review in October 2014 an 11 point action plan was implemented based on the recommendations in the report, 5 of which were able to be closed at the time of the Assurance Action Plan (AAP) in January 2015. Work on the remaining open actions is ongoing. ","AMS and the online channel went live in September 13 and November 13 respectively. Since February 14, all new applications have been processed through AMS with a total of around 28% of applications from overseas and in the UK being made through the new online channel. The programme has now transitioned both AMS and the online channel into business as usual. ","The delivery confidence at Q2 FY14/15 reflected the fact that the Programme was entering a critical phase with many time-sensitive activities subject to external international dependencies. Most notably, there was a significant reliance on the six-nation Certification and Qualification Committee (CQC) to sentence the remaining evidence needed in time to support the award of Military Certification which would allow operation of the first aircraft.  Secondly, there was a dependency on Airbus Defence & Space to supply an aircraft of a mature enough standard to pass UK acceptance checks. Finally, aircraft acceptance to provide a 'Day 1' capability was also dependant upon the ability to support flying operations in accordance with engineering maintenance contractual obligations.
More than 20 formal governance meetings were held throughout August and September 2014 in order to carefully manage risks associated with delivery and first operational flight; these included operator level working groups through to a series of executive-level readiness reviews, and meetings with industry. This approach ensured that all support requirements were in place at RAF Brize Norton. The first A400M aircraft (ZM400) arrived at RAF Brize Norton on 17 November 2014 and completed its first training sortie the following day, as planned.
Many key Programme targets had to be achieved to facilitate support for the first aircraft including: the successful Transfer of Title of the Full Flight Simulator and commencement of aircrew training at RAF Brize Norton; UK logistical support declared as 'ready to support'; interim infrastructure works completed; Military certification in place to allow operation of the first aircraft; and the In Service Support Business Case approved with contract signature achieved. ","The development of the full AIRSEEKER capability continues to make good progress and delivery confidence has received some significant boosts. Following the approval of an Interim Release to Service (RTS) by the Assistant Chief of the Air Staff, 51 Squadron completed a rapid Op HERRICK work-up enabling deployment of the capability on 14 July 14. Also in July, the contract was awarded for the RAF Waddington infrastructure project and Initial Operating Capability (IOC) for AIRSEEKER was declared on 12 Dec 14. However, although these represent some major milestones, management action is still required to ensure that Full Operating Capability (FOC) is achieved against the required metrics of performance, time and cost. Management attention will continue to focus on 5 key elements: the delivery of a less restrictive RTS that permits flying for routine training; the delivery of the required deployable ground stations, including their transportable infrastructure; the delivery of the infrastructure project at RAF Waddington; the establishment of UK-based training for air and ground crews; and the accurate assessment of final Programme costs. ","The last Major Projects Authority (MPA) Gateway Review of Army 2020 in May 2014 made a number of recommendations relating to the Transformation phase of the Programme.  The Army 2020 Team has now developed a set of milestones to provide a clear way ahead for the cultural and behavioural changes required, as well as producing a mechanism for measuring progress of this work.  Management and measurement focus around the Programme’s benefits and the activity that will realise those benefits is underway. 

","The Major Projects Authority (MPA) review of the Programme in September 2014 raised significant concerns about the programme - including resourcing, governance and planning - and made a series of recommendations. However the review also noted their optimism about the ability of the new leadership team to turn around the programme and its return to stability. Since then very significant progress has been made to return the programme to a point where it should, with appropriate actions, be successful against the original vision and objectives.  An action plan has been developed and taken forward to address all the recommendations made by the MPA Review Team, alongside wider programme delivery. Dedicated resources on the programme have doubled since 2014/15 Q2, with all senior leaders recruited now in post, established and delivering. Plans continue for each project and a ""single version of the truth"" for all key Programme Information is being refined and used widely. The MPA have recognised the strong leadership and positive progress since the arrival of the new leadership team.

 

","The Astute Class submarine project has progressed with the launch of Boat 3 and the first steels being cut for Boat 7. However, the project remains a very technically demanding endeavour and the schedule to deliver the remaining 5 boats is challenging. Whilst the MOD, shipbuilder and supply chain have all learned much from the construction of the first 2 boats, challenges remain, and a number of performance improvement projects, recommended by the MPA, have been established to address the main technical, logistical and management risks and issues. These all involve close working between the MOD and its main suppliers and are providing some evidence of the manufacturing performance required to meet the approved targets for schedule, cost and performance.  All of these business Improvement initiatives are being fed into the Successor Programme.  The recommendations of Cabinet Office MPA review of the Astute Programme, have been taken and are reviewed regularly to ensure adherence.  ","We remain on track to relocate the two Signal Regiments to Stafford from Germany in summer 2015. Construction work to redevelop Beacon Barracks and to build Service Families' Accommodation on MOD-owned land adjacent to the barracks has progressed relatively quickly and, in some cases, buildings are likely to be ready for handover ahead of schedule. The Amber/Green rating reflected the risks associated with the national shortages of construction trade workers and materials and the possibility of a severe winter that would hamper building works. In practice both of our contractors have managed the workforce and materials issues most effectively and the good Autumn and mild start to the Winter period has meant that any adverse weather now is likely not to significantly affect the build schedule. ","The 2014/15 Q2 RAG assessment was based on the delivery challenges within the core CEPP programmes. The SRO for CEPP issued objectives to improve RAG delivery confidence that were focussed on the major programme risks, specifically, equipment, support, infrastructure and personnel.  This work is progressing with other major achievements including: the Queen Elizabeth naming ceremony; announcement of retaining and operating the second carrier; Main Gate approval and move to contract for the first operational F35B Lightning II aircraft; and continuing to develop and mature the operating model (with credible evidence) against which future capability choices can be made and supported.  While considerable progress has been made since the last report, delivery challenges remain significant, especially for the QEC programme. ","Seven of the 14 Mk6 Chinook aircraft have now been delivered to the UK. Strong governance, close programme oversight and effective stakeholder engagement by the SRO continue to mitigate risks to delivery. ","The department is continuing to manage ongoing issues such as skills, capabilities and dependencies through the maturing governance process.","The Delivery Confidence Assessment reflected the challenges consequent on the project following the Secretary of State's announcement, on 6th March 2014, of his intent to refuel HMS Vanguard, and to maintain options to refuel HMS Victorious. This requirement to manufacture two additional cores has resulted in a five year deferment of phase 2 of regeneration, which is now forecasting completion in 2026 (Full Operating Capability(FOC)), with programme closure following demolition of old facilities in May 2029. The project delivery team and Rolls-Royce continue to work together to reduce the time and cost impact of this change of requirement. There is currently no anticipated impact to the Astute or Successor boat programmes.

 ","CSSCP is now graduated from GMPP and a new programme, dedicated to the delivery of the Contracting Purchasing and Finance (CP&F) project, was initiated in 2014. The remaining live, and much smaller, projects that sat within CSSCP were transferred to other Governance arrangements.  ",CROWSNEST has completed the competition phase with Thales being selected as the successful Mission System bidder. Main Gate approval remains on course for end of Q1 2016.,Exempt under section 26 of the Freedom of Information Act (2000),"Following the MPA PAR in February 14, it was recommended that to improve delivery confidence, the DCNS Programme be disaggregated and closed as a programme. In May 2014, a new SRO was appointed and his assessment aligned with the findings of the PAR, in that DCNS was too ambitious.  The five enclosed projects were grouped into three smaller and more deliverable programmes (Infrastructure, Networks and Applications).  These are subject to programme validation reviews in spring 2015.  The encompassed projects are driving forward at pace.","The MPA RAG rating at 2014/15 Q2 acknowledged that the totality of the programme could not be delivered within its approved timeline.  Plans were put into effect to assess the capability that would need to be transferred into successor programmes and approval sought to enact this.  DII will end as a programme in March 2015, with GRAPEVINE1 providing successor services and supporting the delivery of the DII capability identified as outstanding beyond March 2015.  A high level of activity is required of DII, however, before programme closure on 31 March 2015.","Whilst the FR20 Programme remains on track to meet all its benefits, there has been particular focus on the Army’s ability to meet its new entrants target as outlined in the Written Ministerial Statement put before the House of Commons on 19 December 2013. The Red Q2 MPA RAG rating reflects the significant MPA concerns over whether the Army would meet its manpower growth targets. Since then, there has been progress across the overall programme with particular success in the creation of the conditions for expansion of the Reserves, principally in the formation of the Defence Relationship Management organisation, further enactment of the Defence Reform Act and a significant improvement in the coherence and effectiveness of communications and marketing strategies. In July 2014 the Secretary of State (SofS) directed that the FR20 programme be divided into four independent, albeit related programmes comprising FR20 (Maritime), the Army Reserve Development Programme (ARDP), FR20 (Royal Air Force) and FR20 (Centre). The FR20 (Centre) programme has the additional responsibility of helping with the delivery of Joint Force Command FR20 projects.  With this disaggregation of responsibility each programme now has its own SRO.  Also, as part of the changes in governance, Vice Chief Defence Staff (VCDS) and Permanent Under Secretary (PUS) were charged with providing assurance of the coherence and progress of the programmes.  As the most significant element, ARDP builds on the FR20 (Army) project (that was part of the previous FR20 construct) and will continue to be centrally assured with MOD and the Cabinet Office. Supporting the ARDP SRO is a newly appointed 2* Programme Director. ARDP has instigated a number of measures to increase inflow and reduce the time it takes for new applicants to be processed, and improve applicant experience including: streamlining the security clearance process; streamlining of the medical screening process; removal of the requirement for employer consent to join the Army Reserve for Civil Servants and Public Service employees; and increased responsibility by and empowerment of the Chain of Command in nurturing applicants through the process.","The Project Assessment Review in July 2014 reinforced the need to continue the reforms following the completion of the Customer Design mandate in April 2015, and re-confirmed the original objectives were broadly on track.  To ensure that the implementation of reforms continued post April 2015, the September Acquisition Architecture Board, which oversees the work of Customer Design and is chaired by PUS, considered and approved plans for Director General (DG) Head Office & Commissioning Services, in his role as the Defence Authority for the Acquisition System and supported by the Acquisition System Authority, to manage and monitor the ongoing work.","At 2014/15 Q2 it was assessed that that the programme was taut but that Initial Operating Capability (IOC) was achievable on time and to cost. Challenges within the Equipment, Infrastructure and Logistics Defence Lines Of Development DLOD, were the main drivers leading to the overall delivery confidence assessment.  The Equipment DLOD had two main issues. The first was the inability to reach a decision on a solution to airframe fatigue, leading to contract delay but not yet causing programme slip. The second factor was a possible projected delay to the production of ""Block 3F"" standard software, which is critical to IOC. Since Q2 a solution to the fatigue problem has been identified and agreed, and the likely slip to the software release will not affect IOC. Progress in the Infrastructure DLOD was noted as being slow, however the SRO reported that an adequate scale of infrastructure would be available to enable IOC. Progress has now been made on gaining planning approval for the build, with Permitted Development being approved. The logistics DLOD report was occasioned by the lack of maturity of the through life sustainment plan for the Air System. Since Q2 the Lightning II Sustainment Strategy has been developed. This document lays out clearly what the sustainment strategy is through life and work is progressing through 2015 to better understand sustainment costs and to contract for the initial sustainment contract for RAF Marham. At the programme level the lack of appropriately resourced Programme Management Office was identified as being a Programme Risk, as was the lack of resource available to the DLODs themselves. This contributed to the overall Q2 Delivery Confidence. Wider Air command work is looking at both the provision of Portfolio Management Office (PMO) and resource to the DLODs. ","The programme reached another significant milestone in August with the receipt, on time, of the three bids (the two commercial bids and the In House Proposal). There were clearly still challenges ahead with the evaluation of the bids to be undertaken and the formal approvals process to complete, hence the Q2 delivery confidence rating. Since the period of this return a robust and thorough evaluation process has been undertaken which included bidders submitting a Best And Final Offer (BAFO). To provide added rigour to the process an external independent observer was appointed. Alongside the evaluation the regular engagement with the approvals community (including HMT and CO) was stepped up to ensure that the resulting Main Gate Business Case met the needs of all parties. The Business Case was approved by the MOD's Investment Appraisal Committee and the Defence Board in January 2015.
",A number of actions/recommendations were identified from a Gateway 0 Review in November 2013 and are being tracked. A further Gateway 0 Review will be conducted in 2015/16.,The MARSHALL Programme continues to be given oversight by a Programme Board chaired by the Senior Responsible Owner (SRO). Scrutiny is currently focussed on ensuring that the Programme can meet vesting day and transition milestones. Greater confidence and clarity of the current MPA RAG rating assessment will become more evident as the programme progresses through the transition phase. ,"The MCSP remains within the Performance, Cost and Time envelope defined in the Main Gate Business Case (MGBC) approval with Initial Operating Capability (IOC) already achieved within the not to exceed approval date (September 2014) with some acceptable capability limitations which will be overcome by Full Operating Capability (FOC), which is forecast for June 2015.","The delivery confidence assessment for Q2 2014/15 was based on a level of uncertainty in the wider MCC Programme, particularly with reference to the Armour and Mechanised Infantry projects – both at that time requiring additional project definition. The financial variance also meant that the assessment was appropriate.  
 
There have been significant changes to the MCC Programme since Q2 2014/15.  Following a Cabinet Office assurance review in Apr 2014 and extensive consultation with MOD Head Office and the MPA, the SRO has split the previous large MCC Programme into the four constituent programmes above enabling increased focus on the individual programmes.  
","Since Q2 2013/14 the NGEC Programme was rebaselined and approved in Q4 2013/14 which has resulted in a revised delivery confidence of Amber/Green as at Q2.

Further independent assurance reviews were undertaken in Q2 and Q3 2014/15 and action plans are in place. 
","In response to the MPA Gateway Review of June 2014, NEM has continued to build a strong evidence base to support policy decision making. The result is that we have greater confidence in the benefits and costs of our major proposals, including Pay Reform and Accommodation Charging. The Strategic Outline Case for the programme has been approved, and the stakeholders are committed to deliver changes in 2015 and 2016.",Exempt under section 24 of the Freedom of Information Act (2000),The programme has made good progress achieving all of its milestones in line with the agreed delivery plan. A robust deployment is now in place which was absent at the time of Q2 publication and which was the primary reason for the delivery confidence assessment.  ,"All upgraded aircraft have now been delivered to the UK. Delivery of capability is progressing steadily as the necessary Release-to-Service clearances are achieved.
An OGC Gateway 4 Review took place in Mar 15 and confirmed good progress.","At Q2 a significant amount of build activity on the critical path for HMS Queen Elizabeth remained behind schedule.  The programme was assessed as Amber / Red due to uncertainty over the ability to recover the backlog of outstanding work and to control costs.  The lack of useable Management Information (MI) was also a concern.  The lack of useable MI remains a concern although recent engagements between DE&S and Navy Command HQ have now established a clear path to a useable MI tool. Once the analysis of the third (following the Programme rebaselining in May 14) Estimate at Completion (EAC3) and the new build Schedule has been finalised, a robust baseline will be established from which to move forward. ","The delivery confidence reflected the ongoing contract negotiations and re-approval for the demonstration and manufacture phases.  Since this time, re-approval has been gained and a contract has been placed.  ","The Strategic Business Partner Implementation is green because objectives to date have been met and Defence is confident that the remaining objectives are achievable. Mobilisation was successfully completed and on 3 Sep the Strategic Business Partner took on leadership and management of the DIO. Revised governance structures have been put in place and are being used by Defence as planned to manage the performance of the SBP and wider DIO. A recent MPA review has concluded that there are no remaining procurement issues to be addressed, and has recommended that work on incorporation is taken forward as a separate project. This project has now been established. The SBPIP can therefore now be closed.","The main focus has been on identification and realisation of benefits and the achievement of  the delivery of the Foundation Contracts (FC).  These embed the commitment from industry to their benefit targets.  The Rolls-Royce FC was signed in February 2013, the BAES FC was signed in July 2013 and Babcock's FC equivalent, the Maritime Support Delivery Framework (MSDF), was signed in September 2014.  There is increased confidence in achieving the £900m SEPP Planning Round 2011 (PR11) target with SEPP having realised a greater savings profile than initially planned.","The MPA report was issued on 3 March 2014. The principal recommendations around commercial, financial and Government/Industry structures and governance arrangements are being taken forward under Project ADVANCE. The delivery confidence assessment was based on: strengthened governance provided by the Defence Nuclear Executive, Future Strategic Deterrent Management and Successor Programme Boards; and, the initiation of work to examine the optimisation of organisational design, commercial and financial arrangements to deliver the Successor programme being conducted jointly by MoD, HMT and the Major Projects Authority, which is due to report in mid 2015.  The project is also benefitting from a substantial business improvement initiative led jointly by the MoD and the main Tier 1 suppliers.  Overall progress with developing the submarine platform and propulsion system design is progressing satisfactorily.  The Integrated Master Schedule has been consolidated and principal contractors’ schedules are aligned.","We understand that the MPA’s RAG rating of Amber / Red at Q2 was based on its assessment of the impact of delay to award of the Managed Service Provider contracts and concern over how these private sector companies would integrate with DE&S once on contract. Since Q2, DE&S has awarded contracts in November 2014 (7 weeks later than planned) for Managed Service Provider support on Project Delivery (Work Package 1) to Bechtel and CH2MHILL and on Human Resources (Work Package 3) to PWC.  Senior personnel from these companies are now embedded in the Materiel Strategy team and the wider DE&S, and are in the process of working with DE&S staff to define the ‘end-state’, design the transformation and plan its implementation. The Materiel Strategy team is closely managing the challenge of integrating services across all three companies.  In January 2015, DE&S and the three Managed Service Providers agreed a Collaboration Charter which establishes the framework and principles on which the Managed Service Providers are being integrated into DE&S and sets out the collaborative behaviours which they are required to demonstrate under the terms of their contract.  The approach is firmly based on all three providers working to a single integrated plan, collaborative behaviours and aligned commercial incentives.","Project Vector has been established by DE&S and BAES in order to better define cost, risk and its apportionment with a view to providing the robust evidence required to deliver a successful manufacture Main gate submission by the end of 2015. Programme momentum has been maintained and progress made towards approval of the T26 Demonstration Phase. Programme momentum has been maintained with the approval of the T26 Demonstration Phase, which will further mature the design and build the body of evidence required to secure a successful main investment decision.",Funding of future upgrades to ensure that Typhoon delivers its required capability outputs continues to be progressed through the approvals process.  An agreement has been reached with the EuroFighter Partner Nations for the UK to progress some key UK-only requirements which will significantly de-risk delivery timelines.  Shared integration of Stormshadow has been agreed and contracted for in partnership with KSA,The Wildcat Programme remains within the Cost and Performance envelope as defined in the Main Gate Business Case approval with all Performance risks being satisfactorily mitigated. ,"The capability is still in development and will require considerable further development to reach the Full Operating Capability in 2017.  WATCHKEEPER is a first-of-type Unmanned Air System (UAS) and there is no other bench-mark system to compare progress against. The most significant challenge is the establishment of the training systems and capacity in the UK for this novel capability which will sustain the growth of the capability, whilst simultaneously conducting the test and evaluation of the FOC capability. This will require careful management of the initial small cohort of military and civilian operators and instructors in 2015/16. The other significant challenge will be the development of Boscombe Down airfield to sustain routine WATCHKEEPER operations including the more flexible and efficient use of take-off slots and airspace. This should provide the appropriate governance across the Watchkeepeer stake-holders to generate the momentum and agility required to achieve FOC.   ","The Amber delivery confidence assessment reflects a combination of good progress towards operational delivery, risk concerning reprovision of CHE storage and a reduced level of benefits compared with the Main Gate Business Case (MGBC) forecast.  The programme is exploring options with the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) for CHE reprovision.   The benefits numbers are being rebaselined.","The Delivery Confidence reflects the completion of the programme aims.
Her Majesties Courts & Tribunals Service continues to keep the use of its estate under review to ensure it meets operational requirements. As part of these reviews, the total number of courts to be closed under CERP was reduced from 142 to 140.","The Delivery Confidence rating reflects the outcome of the most recent Independent Assurance review, which stated it is well placed with plans in hand to deliver on schedule, but a full review of the capacity and capabilities of the team is needed to ensure continued implementation and rollout momentum. This includes taking steps to recruit an experienced contract manager to the team. 

Whilst great progress has been made against the risks highlighted by the review team, (including the appointment of a contract manager in September 2014), other risks have been identified. These include planning for a seamless solution handover to the business and ensuring plans are in place to deliver realisation of benefits. Mitigating plans are being drawn up and agreed. Whilst rollout has commenced, challenges do still exist. 

The Programme is well placed to delivery as planned.","The Delivery Confidence rating reflects the scale and complexity of the Programme and the need to change the approach to an agile development methodology.

In response, the delivery approach needs to be developed and agreed with all stakeholders. 

Particular areas of focus were: 
• The need for clear agreement of the way forward,
• Streamlining the governance as part of the HMCTS Reform Programme including clear delegations,
• Formal agreement of a Business Case.

The Business Case is progressing through governance and there is good engagement with all key stakeholders.
","The Delivery Confidence rating reflects national roll out commencing in October 2014 after a successful test phase during summer 2014, with all key milestones on track.  

The programme is now mid way through the transfer of granting legal aid from Her Majesties Courts and Tribunal Services (HMCTS) to the LAA.  Take up of electronic application forms (eForms) has been significantly greater than predicted and continues to increase as roll out progresses. Initial figures for the London area were lower than experienced elsewhere due to the date on which the area transferred skewing data, however targeted intervention has resulted in improvements.

The most recent independent assurance review in December 2014 recommended several actions for the Programme to take. These included a review of the planning assumptions, contingency options and a programme stock take. The Programme held a stock take session in January through which members were able to review the Programme’s progress and put in place plans moving forward. The review also commended the collaborative working between HMCTS and the LAA.

The Programme planned to mandate the use of eForms in July.  This has been delayed in line with the procurement process.  ",The Delivery Confidence rating reflects successful signing of contracts for all 4 Lots on 1 August 2014 and the project moving into mobilisation phase.,"The Delivery Confidence rating reflects the programme managing the last of its contract procurements and moving into the delivery phase.  

Some delays were experienced in the End User Computer Systems (EUCS) and WAN/LAN procurements but both have now been successfully let. The Application Management Services (AMS) Lot 1 procurement was let at the end of December. AMS Lot 2 contracts are due to be signed in the first quarter of 2015.

The programme has worked closely with the new suppliers to mobilise their transition teams to deliver FITS services.   

Overall the benefits are on track for delivery.
",The Delivery Confidence rating has improved over the past year. Costed bids for the Compliance and Enforcement Service solution have been received and are being evaluated.,"The Delivery Confidence rating reflects the complexity of the Programme, owing to the scale and integrated approach imperative to achieving the desired objectives of reform. 

Particular areas of focus are: 
• The need for clear leadership, 
• Developing a unified and joined up vision, 
• Formal agreement of a realistic and deliverable Business Case so that all the issues are fully explored, 
• Streamlining of programme governance.

From January 2015, the programme adopted a two phase approach. Phase 1 is currently in Delivery and Phase 2 in Design. These two phases will run concurrently until June when the outcomes of the design phase will enable a review of how the programme is broken down and an opportunity to consider different project groupings. A Reform Programme Director and other members of the programme leadership team are now in post and recruitment continues on other key posts.","The Delivery Confidence rating reflects the continued challenges in migrating users to the new system, and the programme's on-going efforts to improve the user experience by implementing enhancements to it.

Delivery Confidence has subsequently improved.","The Delivery Confidence rating reflects the implementation of the changes on schedule on 1 April 2013.

",The Delivery Confidence rating reflects the challenges faced by this well run and tightly managed programme. It is delivering into a contested environment where legal challenge is the norm and at a time when a General Election is close. These external realities have created scheduling issues in the delivery plan which the programme can neither avoid nor resolve on its own. ,"The Delivery Confidence rating reflects the good progress made to date by the programme, but acknowledges the challenges still to come.

The Shared Service organisation within MoJ experienced industrial action in Summer 2014. An agreement was reached with DTUS. There were slight disruptions to the business, but contingency measures were put in place which limited these.  

The programme is on track to move to the new Operating Platform in 2016.","The Delivery Confidence rating reflects progress in line with plan. 

Milestones achieved to date include:
• Planning approved, 
• Site acquired,
• Preferred bidder announced for the construction.","The Delivery Confidence rating reflects the main rollout phase of the programme being paused in August 2014, due to performance issues with the live service. It was subsequently re-started, but further operational service issues in March 2015 have led to an independent review by Deloitte. Whilst awaiting the outcome of that review, significant work has been completed to ensure the live service has been kept in a stable and usable state.  

The programme is preparing for a decision to restart roll out in late June 2015.

Separately, commercial negotiations are ongoing. These will give the programme the contractual right to cease the contract, and obtain a satisfactory settlement from the provider.
","The Delivery Confidence rating reflects the successful award of one prison (HMP Northumberland) to the a private sector provider (Sodex), with service commencing on 1st December 2013. 

Following a review by the Secretary of State it was announced in November 2013 that the competition for the South Yorkshire Cluster would end and the prisons remain in the public sector.

 The Programme is now moving towards closure.","The Delivery Confidence rating reflects the high degree of confidence that the programme will deliver the planned savings, but that there are concerns that the wider benefits of implementing cultural change and new ways of working in prisons may not be fully realised by March 2016. This was confirmed by an independent assurance review in December 2014.  

Prisons that have concluded the transition phase of benchmarking are generally showing improved performance, but due to a combination of staff vacancies and increased prison population there remain challenges in applying benchmarking across the whole estate.  Recruitment activities are gaining momentum and there is increasing evidence that the workforce vacancy position is improving significantly. The increased Competing Delivery of Services savings remain on track and the prison estate restructuring savings have been delivered.","The Delivery Confidence rating reflects the delivery challenges, complexity and timescales faced by the programme. 

The programme has actively continued to mitigate risks and resolve issues, including:
• the appointment of a dedicated senior assurance lead and specialist financial advisors, 
• creation of dedicated implementation and assurance governance arrangements, 
• six months shadow running, 
• five test gates supported by external independent expertise.","The Delivery Confidence rating reflects the good progress across the programme, with all key milestones delivered to time and quality but with some projects at key stages of complex procurements. This stretch on capacity created inherent risks requiring active management to ensure delivery.

On 15 December 2014, new education contracts were awarded in Young Offender Institutions (YOIs), with a focus on increasing and improving the quality of education delivered. The new service began on 1 March 2015 with 15 hours of education delivered per learner per week. The aim is to double this by the end of August 2015. 

Final bids for Secured Training Centre (STCs) were received in February 2015. These bids are now in the final stages of evaluation.
","Supplier delivery issues have required re-base lining and re-contractualising the implementation plan; firstly in December 2011 (which was contained within the HMT and Group Investment Board (GIB) approvals envelope), and again by December 2014, following the recommendations of  an MPA Gateway Review in November 2012 driven largely by the Supplier's issues with their original solution. (This was a change to the core Desktop solution from a discontinued Oracle/Sun product set, at the Suppliers cost, to a revised capability based on a new virtual desktop with supporting Infrastructure and Data Centre consolidation). ","The RAG status was given by the MPA's Project Validation Review in August 2014.  Since then most of the recommendations from the review have been implemented and the remaining recommendations are in the process of being implemented.  
Risks are managed through the programme's risk register and constraints are monitored and mitigated.",The project team have no outstanding corrective actions due to Green MPA status.,"
The Census Programme remains on track to formally close on 1st October 2014. Further benefits quantification is now complete, supporting realisation of full benefits to users within 14 months, with overall benefits to users assessed at 9 times programme cost.


","
Phase 1: The National Statistician made her recommendation to the UK Statistics Authority 27 March 2014 and the Head of the Authority has endorsed the recommendation to the Minister for the Cabinet Office, who has responded in support of the recommendation.

Phase 2:  Good progress has been made on business case development and implementation planning.","Earlier delivery issues  resolved by the project team and ONS Executive,  putting in place a clear strategy to complete the highest priority activity under the original scope, secure on-going functionality, and undertake future development of the system.
Project development on track to deliver the migration of over 100 spreadsheets to one consolidated system. Benefits include financial, quality and risk reduction as a result of standardising and automating the collection and validation process for CPI/RPI data. 

","
An external assurance review held July 2014, agreed the programme was well placed to procure an online survey tool and confirmed its  place as a key transformation project for the ONS.","
The programme has made significant progress  - All of the planned ESA10/BPM6 changes for Blue Book 2014 (which equates to approximately 70% of the overall number of recommendations) have been delivered into live production and the programme team are on track to publish Blue Book 2014 on 31 October 2014. The scope for  Blue Book 2015 has been signed off and planning for delivery is well underway. 
","
The final release of the WDA Data Explorer and Application Programming Interface (API) tools went live on the 28 July 2014, and have remained stable in the month post launch. There has been a planned increase in the number of datasets available within the tools, and it is planned to continue loading Census datasets over the coming months and introduce non Census datasets.

","Summary  - During the previous period the focus was on the ISSC programmes to get them onboard and stable.  During the next period more attention will be given to re-establishing the NGSS vision and ensuring there is a strategy for the ISSCs through the to contract exit and re-tender.  The management of overall governance needs to be improved, a framework has been developed and a roll out plan is in place.  

Programme - This last programme phase has seen the stabilisation of MCA, with some post go live learnings encountered for future migrations, particularly on the effectiveness of testing end to end processes effectively. The first two large departments are now approaching go-live with EA go-live scheduled for July 27th 2015 (ISSC2) and DfT scheduled for 1 August 2015 (ISSC1), and on track, although small delays are possible.  The quality of supplier programme plans has now improved for both ISSC1 and 2 to a detailed level that customer programme managers can use to track programme progress more effectively, however overarching programme plans are still required which Crown Oversite Function (COF) will now develop so that an overall critical path and associated resourcing risks can be managed.  Significant programme delays are causing operational risks to departments facing end of support for current systems.  Contingencies are in place but need close monitoring. 

Commercial - Commercial renegotiation has taken place with avarto which was required to make the contract financially viable for the supplier, and customers are in agreement with the new terms. Similar negotiations will be undertaken with ISSC2, although primarily this is to establish cost allocation for additional costs incurred by both customers and suppliers due to missed programme milestones and scope creep.  Potentially CNC will leave the ISSC1 contract due to the delays causing them untenable operational risk due to end of life issues of current systems.  Civil Nuclear Constulbary (CNC). The business case overall remains positive although processes still need to be put in place to manage the business case at a detailed level.  Governance improvements.  

BAU - The BAU service has remained solid although the governance and reporting of BAU is being improved to ensure that any issues encountered post go live of new systems implementations are identified and rectified early. 

Due to the nature of this programme, the end date is expandable depending on new government departments signing up to one of the ISSC's. The end date is then re-planned, taking into consideration the transition period of the the new department. ",The CPS is confident that the redefined programme structure will deliver to the timescales set out above.,On schedule to deliver on all timescales,"Since the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 received Royal Assent in January 2014, this project has moved into implementation phase.  There have been 3 public consultations on various pieces of secondary legislation associated with the framework and 4 commencement orders which have allowed parts of the framework to be introduced to enable transferee bodies to take on some of their functions under the new arrangements. These include the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) - to register supervisory bodies and issue guidance and the NAO - to consult on, and lay, a new code of audit practice. ","Phase 1 of the Superfast Broadband Programme is progressing well. It is on track for superfast broadband coverage to reach 90% of premises by early 2016 ahead of schedule, as highlighted by the NAO report published in January 2015.

","Progress against the major milestone (the ""1 million homes"" target) is on schedule.",The Start Date represents when engagement with the market began with industry days and pre-qualification. The End Date marks the completion of the scope of the Client Specification.,"The start date reflects Royal Assent to the Energy Act 2008, which includes the legal powers that underpin the RHI. DECC opened the domestic RHI for applications in April 2014 and implemented extensions to the non-domestic scheme in May 2014.  The project end date allows for a post-implementation phase and will be reviewed before the end of 2014/15.","On schedule for 2020.

The project is on schedule to deliver by closure date.,Project delivery is currently on schedule.,None.,"The first three batches, Hertfordshire Luton and Reading, the North East and North West reached Financial Close in March 2015. The two remaining batches, Yorkshire and the Midlands are expected to reach Financial Close by August 2015. We currently have 23 schools under construction. This number is set to increase to 36 by December 2015. Our first school is scheduled to open in the North East at the end of December 2015. We are still on programme to meet our December 2017 deadline.","As of 5 June 2015, we have: 26 schools open in new buildings; 107 schools for which construction contracts have been signed and we are working with all the schools in the programme. This month the programme hit the public commitment to open 24 schools before the General Election.","By end September 2014, construction of the airport was approximately 70% complete. Currently the project is running to time for opening in early 2016, and to budget, though significant challenges remain. A separate contract has been signed for the management of aviation and ground fuels, and bids have been received for the provision of air services.",Pre application consultation was held in April and concluded in June 2014 which was earlier than originally baseline. Submission of the Development Consent Order application was re-scheduled to the end of 2014 to allow for the inclusion of design changes identified as a result of feedback from the public consultation and to allow for changes and revisions in traffic model data. Project is on track to be open for traffic by end 2020.,"The Crossrail programme is on schedule. Crossrail services are on track to be fully operational from December 2019. Beyond this, as with all projects there will be some project close down activities that have been planned to be completed in 2020","The programme has made excellent progress against plan since September 2014. In addition to the achievements set out above, we have accomplished the following:
Phase 1
• High Speed Rail Phase One Hybrid Bill – Following the deposit of the Hybrid Bill in November 2013 an Additional Provision (AP), proposing 55 minor amendments, was deposited on 10 September 2014. Progress on petitions against the Hybrid Bill and AP is on schedule with 344 petitioners having been heard by the Bill Committee by March 2015 and a further 99 petitioners withdrawing, along with 22 who were denied standing by the Committee. The rate of hearings are set to increase during 2015.
Preparing for Delivery
• Development Agreement - On 8 December 2014, DfT and HS2 Ltd signed a Development Agreement for the HS2 project.  The Agreement provides clarity over roles and responsibilities of the two organisations: DfT as sponsor and client and HS2 Ltd as adviser and delivery body.
Land and Property 
• HS2 property compensation package – On 16 January 2015 the Secretary of State announced the Government’s package of measures to help owner occupiers along the line of route for Phase One of High Speed 2, from London to the West Midlands.  
• Residents’ Charter & Commissioner – 16 January 2015 also saw HS2 Ltd launch a Residents’ Charter to help ensure that residents are treated in a fair, clear, competent and reasonable manner.  A new Residents’ Commissioner overseeing the charter, Deborah Fazan, will ensure that HS2 Ltd meets its commitments set out in the new charter.
• Strategic Environmental Assessment Judgement – On 25 November 2014 the Court of Appeal found in the Government’s favour by agreeing with the High Court’s previous judgment that a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) was not required before making safeguarding directions to protect the planned route for Phase One of HS2. The Government has now won 20 out of 21 judicial challenges to the project.
• Safeguarding the Route between Fradley and Crewe - The consultation on safeguarding the route between Fradley and Crewe was launched on 4 November 2014 and closed on 6 January 2015. 105 responses were received, which are being analysed to support a ministerial decision later this year.  
Wider Benefits
• Growth and Regeneration – The Growth Taskforce published its report ‘HS2: get ready’ on 21 March 2014. This set out a number of recommendations on ensuring the whole country shares in the job and business opportunities HS2 will deliver. ‘Getting set for HS2: responding to the HS2 Growth Taskforce’ was published on 24 July 2014 setting out how Government and HS2 Ltd will work with local areas and businesses to ensure the wider economic growth benefits of HS2 are maximised. The recommendations have been progressed and, as part of this, Greater Birmingham and Solihull were awarded funding for 2015/16 to support the development of local plans for HS2-related growth/connectivity.

Key milestones achieved have been putting in place remedial arrangements and support for areas unable to sign off a plan of sufficient quality/ambition, reviews undertaken for area plans in October and the majority of plans reaching approved status by January 2015.

Phase 2 of the Taskforce was an extension not initially planned for when the TaskForce was first set up. The extension developed in order to allow the TaskForce to fulfil its objectives and coordinate continuing support required by a number of areas facing challenges in submitting plans of the required detail and quality, as well as to ensure that the appropriate implementation support and planning was in place in the run up to April 2015.
","The Trust had an approved OBC from HMT in May 2014. This was two years later than originally planned. This delay was due to several factors, the main one being the requirement to secure planning permission prior to submission. Planning consent was achieved in January 2012. The OBC was subsequently re-approved by NHS SEC  after which the DH/MT approval process was set in motion. Following the OBC approval the Trust completed the FBC which was approved by the Trust Board in September 2014 and then submitted to the TDA in October. Market testing continued throughout this period in order for the GMP to be ready as stated in the summer of 2015. The decant programme also continued and is due to be completed at the end of 2015. FBC approval by the TDA is pending following the recent  Board meeting .","As at 30th September 2014 all activities were on programme - the site generator had been relocated; the old PMVA building and the boiler house chimneys had been demolished; the top soil had been stripped; the foundations had been removed.  During the period 1st October 2014 - 31st March 2015 the following (will) have taken place - water main for new Hospital; cut and fill continues; foundation piling (1 x ward block, central building and new entrance building); pre-cast concrete frame installation; off-site construction (concrete and windows); delivery of off site manufactured service riser modules to serve the bedrooms; further development of operational commissioning and transition planning programme (separate from construction programme) has been ramped up and is progressing well.  All activities are on or slightly ahead of programme.

 before approval and progression onto a “wider roll-out”.","Phase 1 delivery is on track for 1 April 2015. A LGA / ADASS stocktake survey completed in September 2014 (prior to delivery of key support products and funding) identified that 97% of councils are very or fairly confident that they will be able to deliver the Care Act reforms from April 2015 and confidence increasing on most measures of progress. Delivery of Phase 2 remains on time for introduction of reforms from 1 April 2016.  Whilst the consultation on the 16/17 reforms has been put back from December 2014, a focused and effective consultation early in 2015 will allow the timetable for Phase 2 to stay on track. ",The cohorts of children to be immunised in each year of the roll out of this programme are not yet finalised as planning is based on the previous years and dependant on confidence around workforce capacity and vaccine supply.  ,"There are no significant deviations from the plan, however exit from contract remains a challenge.",We will publish shortly a report from the interim National Medical Examiner setting out the lessons learned from the pilot sites. The MPA have advised that Death Certification Reforms Programme should cease GMPP reporting and that reporting can be reinstated at a future point when there is a steer on the reforms from the new government.,Acute services consolidation occurred on 1 October 2014 and the emergency department scheme operational on 15 October 2014 as planned there was no deviation from timetable,Planning is underway to determine whether Phase 4 can be implemented by April 2016.,N/A,Programme on track.,On schedule.

Workforce expansion: at the time of preparing this report, the most recent management information (November 2014) published by NHS England estimates an indicative count of 11,290 FTE health visitors; 3,198 more than the May 2010 baseline, representing an increase of 40%. At the time of preparing this report, the latest official figures  (September 2014) show there were 10,800 full time equivalent health visitors; 2,708 more than in May 2010. Since 2010 around 7,500 health visitor training places have been commissioned, with the annual total growing from around 550 to around 2,700 in 2013, representing a five-fold increase in the number of health visitor trainees starting their training.  This investment in training has delivered most of the expansion in health visitor workforce we are now seeing.  In addition, there are a further 1,200 training places being commissioned in 2014/15 - this will ensure that the workforce growth is sustained beyond the end of the programme.

Service transformation: at the time of preparing this report, the new service model has been tested in early implementer  sites and case study material published. These sites saw increases in the numbers of children receiving the 2-2½ year review almost double.  We have six published priorities for demonstrating success and building sustainable services. Data collection and reporting is in place so that delivery of service transformation can be demonstrated.

Transfer of health visitor commissioning to Local Authorities: at the time of preparing this report, the Baseline Agreement Exercise has been issued to support the issuing of allocations to Local Authorities in February 2015 and the draft regulations to mandate key checks have been published.","Since the programme was re-configured in July 2013, the schedule has remained stable. At that time, a plan was agreed that Liaison and Diversion services would be rolled-out in increments each year until full coverage in England could be achieved, by April 2017. This remains the plan, and to this end, the first wave of services went live in April 2014, with a further wave of services due to go live in April 2015. Together, these first two waves will provide population coverage of Liaison and Diversion services to over 50% of the population of England. All of these services will conform to the national commissioning specification for Liaison and Diversion services that was first agreed in September 2013. Planning commenced in January 2015 for the commissioning of the final waves of Liaison and Diversion service rollout, at the same time that drafting of the Full Business Case commenced.",The Clock View element of the Project is now complete.   The Edge Lane/Old Swan scheme is currently being re-scheduled. ,Approval for an extension for the current contract up to 30th November 2015 is being sought.,"The National PBT Programme remains on schedule to treat first patients in the Spring of 2018. The PBT equipment procurement is at an advanced stage as it is on the critical path of the Programme. In addition, the mandatory assurance and approvals processes have been accelerated by about 6 months - this also provides added assurance to the service commencement date in 2018.","On-going discussions between the  Department of Health, Cabinet Office, NHS England and the Health and Social Care Information Centre seek to secure agreement on the production of a revised funding model & business case approach, taking account of the latest Cabinet Office and  Department of Health spend control guidance. NHS England is responsible for the production of the full 5 year business case, and this will be created alongside the business justification to ensure funding for the current live service (including transformation activities) is secured for the next financial year.                  ","Testing across all required test streams is progressing, however NHS e-Referral Service software defect levels remain higher than expected at this stage of project. Defect fix and release remains on track for e-Referral Service go live by Spring 2015. Future development activity is ongoing but being impacted by focus on go live.
",None,"Following stakeholder direction, the project schedule was extended to July 2017 and project progress is on track","Savings of £307.8 million have been achieved by the Programme at September 2014.  It is worth noting that the Programme is currently scheduled to complete its work by the end of March 2016.  However, if the innovative work on metrics identifies further potential efficiencies, then an implementation phase with Trusts beyond the current life of the Programme may be required. ","The NHSmail 2 Outline Business Case outlined that the service would be procured from the Crown Commercial Service Managed Email framework that was under procurement. The award of the framework was delayed, resulting in a critical path delay to the NHSmail 2 project. As of January 2015, the Managed Email framework has been awarded and contains 5 suppliers. The NHSmail 2 project is in its final stages of procurement. The impact of the delay has been to delay the contract award and subsequent delivery of NHSmail 2. During the delay period the NHSmail 1 service has continued and has provided benefits, meaning that whilst this is a time delay benefits have not been lost.","The Trust has decided to pause the development work on the new hospital for the time being.  Due to the complexities of the approval process, it is expected  that the Trust will be unable to get a decision to proceed before the end of the current Parliament. It is anticipated that with a general election approaching in May 2015 the Trust believe it likely that all new developments will be reviewed in light of its own priorities. As a result, there inevitably will be further delay in the completion of the new hospital and to this end, the key milestones outlined highlighted above are anticipated to change, namely:  start date (DH  / Monitor approval) to 25.9.2015 and the end of project (Mobilisation to the operational phase of PFI2) until 30.8.2019.","Approval to launch was received in November, resulting in a closing date for applications in December and approval of awards in January. The Programme remains on track to distribute the 2014/15 awards by the end of March 2015. A change in the funding profile was negotiated, meaning some awards will be distributed in 2015/16.",The project is expected to reach Financial Close in February 2015.,"The programme schedule for the year was dependent on a procurement  contract which in the end was more complex and took longer than anticipated to reach an acceptable agreement. This delayed the start of the design work but once commenced  remained on schedule over this period - completing the design work by the end of June 2014, and submitting the Outline Business Case (OBC) by the end of July 2014. An ambitious target of a decision on the OBC by the end of September 2014 has been set. Any delay beyond this will push back  any subsequent milestones although opportunities to bring milestones forward will obviously be sought.",Currently on hold.,"A plan was not published in Q2 2014/2015. The Programme has reset its strategic direction and as such the plan is to no longer relevant. The Programme has started to develop a Blueprint out of which agreement on the exit, transition and procurement plans will be developed. The programme end date is the 31st March 2017 when the current contract with N3SP comes to an end.  ",There have been no deviations from the planned schedule.,"Although construction of the new hospital is behind the programme established at Financial Close, the Trust has received significant assurance from the PFI Consortium that the planned completion date will be achieved. Monthly Progress Meetings are held with the PFI Consortium and the Construction Contractor, with the Independent Tester and Technical Advisor to the project funders also present. The PFI contract places all risk of delay and cost overrun with the PFI Consortium.","There has been a change in the schedule timetable since the Q2 2013/14 return, primarily because the scheme has been on hold whilst affordability was reviewed. This has led to the procurement route being altered from PFI to non-PFI, with a revised OBC currently being prepared for issue to the TDA by end January 2015. Currently, the contract is scheduled for financial close July 2015, compared to November 2014 reflected in the Q2 2013/14 return. Construction completion is now scheduled for March 2017, compared to previous milestone of Sept 2016.","The procurement proceeded according to programme through to evaluation of interim submission.
As noted above the Trust is now in a single bidder situation and this may necessitate some changes to future programme.",There have been no deviations from the planned schedule.,"The programme is progressing broadly as planned and the programme team is working closely with all collaborative groups in order to ensure that they submit and gain approval for their Full Business Cases in line with their expectations for signing contracts. There has been a delay to the original programme timescales due primarily to the approvals process for the Outline Business Case taking longer than anticipated, and Trusts taking longer than anticipated to launch their procurements.

The delivery of Spine 2 is broadly made up of two parts: Core Spine, and Care Identity Service.  Core Spine went live 25th August 2014, and Care Identity Service is expected to be live in February 2015.",All actions are on track.,The Programme Plan has been subject to a number of revisions since with the transition (Go-Live) now agreed to commence on 20th February 2015.  Changes to this planned date have been mainly due to the reliance on the Care Identity Service system to go-live prior to Secondary Uses Systems  Transition as this is required to provide secure access to the system. The original date for Care Identity Service Go-Live was in Mid November 2014 but due to technical issues this has now been rescheduled for the 20th February with the SUS Transition System going live simultaneously.,The Programme went live on time. The delivery model has been designed to manage peaks in volumes and the Department expects to deliver as planned. ,"Phase 1 of the Programme is complete.  

Phase 2 of the Programme went live on 30 June 2014.  Phase 2 introduced client charging and triggered the start of proactive 1993/2003 Scheme case closure activity. 
Case closure is being conducted in a way that accords with Ministerial decisions and the Case Closure regulations. The closure programme is expected to take around three years to complete and there are around 900,000 1993 and 2003 scheme cases to close. The aim is to have all statutory scheme clients on one set of assessment rules using one IT system, managed by one organisation.

Segment 1 (nil assessed cases) case closure went live on 30 June 2014 as planned. 

Segment 2 (nil compliant cases) case closure went live on 26 January 2015 as planned. 

Segment 3 (compliant cases off system) and Segment 4 (compliant cases on system) case closure activity started on 18 May 2015 as planned.
Activities are now underway to develop the high level designs to enable closure of our final case closure segment; Segment 5 (enforced cases), and Arrears Only cases.  Both of which are planned to start in 2016.

There are a number of complex issues that remain to be resolved and the Programme has a significant delivery challenge.,"The Fit for Work Programme is now expected to complete its work in October 2015; this is due to a phased implementation being agreed. 

The FfW Advice Service was introduced in Great Britain in December 2014.  The Assessment Service launched a small Proof of Concept in January 2015, prior to the launch of FfW in March 2015.  Our current planning assumption is that the Assessment Service will be rolled out across Great Britain by October 2015.

The Assessment Service went live in Scotland at the end of January 2015.
","A number of new initiatives have been added to the Programme. This change in scope, along with dependencies with other programmes, has resulted in a change to the delivery schedule, including moving the end date of the Programme to 2017. These new initiatives will deliver further fraud, error and debt savings for the taxpayer.","With all elements now introduced, the Project remains on plan for full delivery.","A number of contracts have been successfully re-competed resulting in savings over existing arrangements, notably Security and Networks. The remaining activity is continuing to plan with a number of contract extensions agreed to facilitate safe transition to the new services as they go-live.","All plans are on track and there is no deviation from the planned schedule. Go-live is due in April 2016 with the main enabling IT release scheduled for October 2015. 

In January 2015 the Project achieved a major milestone in signing off its design and IT requirements and gaining approval from HM Treasury and the Cabinet Office to move into the detailed build phase. 
",The Programme has been developed in a number of phases which are on track to deliver. The handover to business as usual will be planned post commencement of the reassessment of the existing DLA caseload in October 2015.  ,"Delivery remains on track against plans announced in September 2014. Additionally the Programme has brought forward testing of initiatives from which the programme can learn including the:
• Continued trialling of Universal Support in partnership areas to ensure the right integrated local foundations are in place to support UC expansion.
• Extending In work progression trials to help households increase their earnings once they have found work.
• Extending the role of UC Work Coaches to engage with households at their work search interview to assess financial capability

Airbus Defence and Space was unable to provide an aircraft that passed the exacting acceptance criteria on schedule to meet the Programme's Capability Milestone 1 (delivery of first aircraft).  This resulted in the Transfer of Title being delayed from September 2014 to November 2014. The aircraft flew to RAF Brize Norton on 17 November 2014 and completed its first training sortie the following day. January 2015 saw Airbus Defence and Space advise OCCAR of a likely revised delivery schedule; this was published formally in February 2015.  The resultant delay to UK A400M aircraft delivery will prevent UK achieving Capability Milestone 2, UK In Service Date (ISD) (planned for March 2015) until September 2015.  The impact of these aircraft delays on subsequent UK milestones can be contained within the revised delivery plan, albeit at increased Programme risk, due to UK Programme Board action to prioritise the builds up of frontline capacity, whilst demanding more efficiency from the UK-specific A400M Defensive Aids modification programme, which is running in parallel with aircraft deliveries.

",AIRSEEKER has delivered an early beneficial use in direct support to operations ahead of the approved Initial Operating Capability (IOC) declaration. Considerable progress against the IOC Programme of Record has been achieved.    The Programme's focus is now on the planned schedule working towards Full Operating Capability in 2017.,"On Schedule.  The structural changes to be implemented as part of the first phase of the Programme are on track, with the main changes due to complete in accordance with the plan during 2015.  The Army 2020 Team is now working to complete the detailed implementation plan for the second and final phase of the Programme, which entails Transformation of the Army so that it is able to deliver its required outputs within reduced resource levels.  This too remains on track.  

","In 2014 the Army Basing Programme (ABP) has seen 30 Units move and/or re-role in the UK, plus one unit move from Germany to the UK, in line with plans.  This has created the conditions for troops to  return from Germany in 2015 to deliver the  Strategic Defence and Security Review promise of 50% of troops out of Germany by 2015. Of those units planning to move in 2015 there are a small number for whom the necessary end-state infrastructure will not be available in the declared timeframe, and work is ongoing to further understand the implications and identify solutions. As of now MOD remains on track to deliver the announced closure of garrisons in Germany in addition to the return of all Army personnel from Germany to the UK by 2020.","The Project remains on schedule to deliver the remaining 5 submarines within the latest approval, although some substantial risks and challenges remain. The first two submarines have been handed over to the Royal Navy and the third was launched in May 2014."," The delivery of living and working accommodation at Stafford for the two Signal Regiments relocating from Germany is on schedule, and in some cases, ahead of schedule. We have a detailed movements plan that will see the units relocate in Summer 2015 enabling us to close Elmpt and Herford Stations in Germany and hand them back to the German Federal authorities by the end of this calendar year.","No change to end date since last year. The Red/Amber RAG status at 2014/15 Q2 reflected the major risks and issues which were apparent in a number of areas such as delivery schedules and support solutions which will require additional maturity.  Progress is closely monitored and reported through CEPP governance processes.  The objectives issued by the Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) are the route to improving the delivery confidence and keeping the programme on schedule, by promptly resolving the risks and issues. This appears feasible at this stage.","Project NEW BUY Initial Operating Capability was achieved on 31 Jan 15, while Project JULIUS Full Operating Capability was declared over 6 months early on 22 Apr 15.

","The requirement to refuel HMS Vanguard, with the option to refuel HMS Victorious, is an extension to the scope approved at Main Gate, and the consequential impact upon CPC is a five year deferment to the approved FOC date (May 2021). This deferment allows the manufacturing of cores for Astute and Successor boat 1 in parallel facilities. The project delivery team and Rolls-Royce continue to investigate potential opportunities to improve the programme's resilience. Phase 1 of regeneration continues to make good progress with the construction and fitting-out of buildings, and purchase and trials of equipment.

The programme should be closed once full operating capability is reached – scheduled for Q1 2025; Armoured Infantry 2026 - The ABSV (as part of the programme) remains an aspiration at this stage but is likely to deliver vehicles on a schedule out to Q4 2026.  At this point, the Armoured Infantry Programme will have reached full operating capability and can be closed. Thus these two programmes will end well in advance of the 2033 date, stated against the previous MCC Programme, because the elongated timelines were applicable to programmes now out of scope of the Armoured Cavalry and Armoured Infantry programmes.","Tranche 1 In Service Date (ISD) took place in Q3 2014/15 and is now in Steady State running, NHP's ISD took place in Q3 14/15 and is now in Steady State.
Tranche 2 ISD is scheduled for Q4 14/15.  Regional Frameworks for Scotland - Successful Bidders letters issued Q3 2014/15. Regional Framework for South West and South East - Contract Award Q4 2015/16. NGEC Programme delay of one year was caused through a combination of delays to approvals, limited number of subject matter experts, the integration of a new Integrated Management System (IMS), the Enhanced Operating Model and the integration of other programmes into NGEC.",The NEM programme remains on track to deliver its agreed remit by 2021; the transition plans for pay reform and accommodation charging will have completed by then. Forces Help To Buy (FHTB) interest-free loan pilot was successfully launched in April 2014. The next milestone is harmonisation of Engagement Structures which will take effect from April 2015. Further change is anticipated in 2016 when a new pay model and accommodation charging system are planned to go-live.,Exempt under section 24 of the Freedom of Information Act (2000),The programme has achieved a number of key milestones in line with the baselined plan and future milestones are on track to be achieved. Release 1 system development completed on time and is in the process of being deployed into the business. Scoping for Release 2 is underway which will provide a firm delivery schedule for the next phase of the programme. ,"Close management of the remaining work, most notably the Release-to-Service approvals, continues to improve delivery confidence.  The programme achieved Initial Operating Capabilities five weeks ahead of schedule on 23 Feb 2015 and is on track to deliver Full Operating Capability on or before their target date.","Some of the Alliance Management Board's initiatives are starting to bite and strike rates are improving in areas.  This is encouraging and we look forward to tangible progress in adherence to schedule, although schedule risks remain.  We continue to work with the Alliance Management Board to mitigate this and to resolve areas critical to the capability of  HMS Queen Elizabeth.  Early indications of progress on Prince of Wales are that build quality is significantly improved and the current performance, cost and time remain on track.  ",The latest approval for SFU includes the full manufacture phase and the above project end date reflects the end of manufacture.,"The SBPIP in on schedule to date.  A recent MPA review has concluded that there are no remaining procurement issues to be addressed, and has recommended that work on incorporation is taken forward as a separate project. This project has now been established. The SBPIP can therefore now be closed.","The programme is on track with benefit identification and delivery underway. The signing of the Foundation Contracts has been achieved (Rolls-Royce in February 2013, BAES in July 2013 and Babcock's MSDF in September 2014).  With all Foundation Contracts signed, SEPP is preparing for the Graduation process from the Defence Major Programmes Portfolio which is scheduled for Spring 2015. ","The Successor assessment phase programme is currently on average three months behind schedule, but key milestones such as the Whole Boat Preliminary Design Review and power plant Critical Design Review have been achieved on time.","DE&S was established as a bespoke trading entity in April 2014. Managed Service Providers are under contract to support DE&S in developing plans to reach a ‘match fit’ end-state. The process of transformational change is to deliver a ‘match fit’ DE&S by April 2017.

","The programme is maintaining current delivery milestones. The known issues which were re-enforced in the July 2014 Project Assessment Review (PAR) precipitated Project Vector and a move to an incremental procurement strategy to bring realism to the programme and adjustment to some of the assumptions may occur over the next year.  These will become clear in late Spring/early Summer 2015 and will bound the Manufacturing Phase delivery assumptions.
","Typhoon Tranche 2 has been declared multi-role capable for air to ground operational missions; The next major milestone for Typhoon is on 31 Dec 18 when Typhoon Tranche 2 and 3 will declare a Stormshadow and Brimstone 2 capability  (the latter almost 2 years earlier than originally planned).  This will align delivery of key weapons with the Out of Service Date for Tornado GR4 and therefore ensure continuous delivery of key UK capability effects from combat aircraft.  Delivery of Tranche 3 aircraft is progressing on schedule.
","The Army (BRH) Initial Operating Capability (IOC) was declared in August 2014, within planned timescale. The Flight Simulators reached a limited standard to support early training and extraordinary management action continues to be applied to build incrementally to the full training system. The revised Mission Support System is due to start implementation in early 2015.  An additional maintenance contract has been let and aircraft availability has significantly improved and is no longer impacting aircrew training. The Navy (SCMR) IOC remains within its Time, Cost and Performance approval and is independent of the Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (FASGW) Programme.",The programme was re-baselined in June 2014. The first major milestone (Initial Operating Capability) was achieved by deploying the capability to Afghanistan in August 2014 at the Operational Capability Unit (OCU) standard. The next milestone is to generate additional capacity of 4 Task Lines (at the OCU standard) in April 2016.  The main effort is to achieve Full Operating Capability (FOC) Apr-Jul 17 with an uplift of the capability to Equipment Standard 2 (ES2). This will require a major Release to Service (RTS) amendment.  The programme remains on track to achieve these milestones.  Achieving programme milestones remains challenging but the re-balancing process has delivered a taut and achievable timeline. ,JAMES completed its rollout as planned in March 2014.  The current delivery Fleet Management and DRACAS are on track.  The requirement for additional CHE storage has changed into a requirement to re-locate and expand the existing storage.  A DIO Initial Gate Business Case (IGBC) for CHE storage will be presented in 2015 setting out the options for the way forward.,"In September 2014 the final court closure, Alton Magistrates’ Court, was completed. ","The programme is on track to deliver as planned:
• Rollout of digital solutions has already commenced,
• The Magistrates In Court Presentation solution is almost 50% complete,
• Wi-Fi installations are on track and national rollout has commenced.","The programme end date has now been re-forecast based on: 
• The new timetable for business case approval, 
• A better understanding of scope and implementation logistics, 
• Feedback from the market as to likely duration of development and deployment.
","The programme is performing well against all planned milestones. 

Of particular note is the successful uptake of eForms, which has been significantly higher than projected. 

The interface for automatic exchange of data between the case management systems at the LAA and HMCTS was implemented on 8th December 2014. It is currently being used by a small number of caseworkers in the Nottingham Criminal Applications Team and caseworkers have been able to take advantage of interdepartmental information sharing by obtaining more accurate data from a range of resources. 

The transfer of the London area was a very important milestone for the programme, due to the area's unique nature.  Throughout its transition the programme followed progress very closely and were able to identify specific issues and provide solutions to these. 

The programme has implemented an extensive engagement plan with providers, to explain the benefits of electronic working.","The programme end date was delayed due to the withdrawal from the competition, and subsequent audit, of the incumbent EM service suppliers.  This impacted decision making on the EM competition and contributed to a protracted preferred bidder phase as lessons were incorporated from the audit.  
",The FITS Programme is moving from its procurement phase into delivery in line with the approved plan.,There is no deviation from revised schedule. The project team is continually assessing the project delivery plan with the aim to pursue the most ambitious timeline. ,Funding has now been agreed and work has commenced on projects that underpin the delivery of the HMCTS Reform Programme. The  end date has now been finalised as 2020.,"Client and Cost Management System (CCMS) is the online system through which providers can submit civil legal aid applications. National rollout of voluntary usage of CCMS commenced on 31st March 2014 and was completed on 29th September.  Contractual Notices outlining the timeline to mandatory use of the system were issued to providers on 26th January 2015. This will mandate the use of CCMS for new legal aid applications from 1st October 2015. The 8 month lead in time is to provide firms with sufficient time to train their staff and integrate the system into their businesses. There has been a steady increase in usage with approximately two-thirds of providers using the system to process applications, equating to c.50% of applications being processed digitally.
The project end date has consequently been revised accordingly.","The programme completed in June 2013, but was retained on the MPA reporting pending an independent post implementation review. This was completed in October 2014 and the programme is now formally closed.","The introduction of the Residence Test for civil legal aid was delayed from 4 August 2014. The Government has appealed the Judicial Review judgment. 

All other reforms scheduled for implementation between December 2013 and July 2014 have been delivered. For example: 
• Restricting the scope of legal aid for prison law, 
• Reducing the use of multiple advocates, 
• Reduction in Expert Fees in Criminal and Civil Family Proceedings, 
• Imposing a financial eligibility threshold in the Crown Court, 
• Harmonising fees paid to self-employed barristers with those paid to other advocates appearing in civil (non-family) proceedings, 
• Court Bundles changes.

Prompted by the judgment in a legal challenge to the 2015 Crime Competition Duty Tender, the MoJ launched a consultation in September 2014 seeking evidence relating to specific technical aspects of the KPMG and Otterburn financial reports. The consultation closed on 15 October 2014. This has delayed the commencement of a competitive tender for crime contracts.","The Programme remains on schedule and continues to work to minimise risks to delivery.

Commercial negotiations with SSCL completed to schedule and a contract to outsource the relevant back office services is in place as of 1st November 2014. Negotiations were supported by Cabinet Office. 

Work is progressing on planning transition activities including arrangements for incumbent suppliers, whose services will continue to be required up to the transition to the ""Independent Shared Service Centre 2"" (ISSC 2) Standard Operating Platform in 2016. 

A project recommendation was approved in October 2014 to defer the migration of Finance data from the legacy system. This transfer was aligned to the end of the 14/15 financial year. This was due to technical issues around data extraction from the old platform ready for the new platform. The data assurance testing is now complete and User Acceptance Testing  (UAT) is now complete. Business readiness preparations are underway. 

The programme is due to exit Steady State and commence transformation. Some initial milestones have been missed as the transformation plan delayed but the programme is working closely with SSCL to bring the timetable back on track.","The project remains on schedule to deliver the first of 2,100 places in February 2017, with a phased rollout of further places throughout 2017.

Funding has been re-profiled to allow construction work to commence earlier.","Deployment of the main rollout activities was paused between August and December 2014, whilst significant performance issues were investigated and corrected. 

The revised remediation plan agreed by the Programme Board, sets out the new phased approach to delivery. This has had significant impact on the schedule, moving the main rollout and programme closure into 2015/16. 

However, some aspects of the programme (printer deployment and Satellite replacement) have now been completed.","The Programme completed all its deliverables in December 2013. Following the standard MPA approach to assess costs and benefits, sufficient time operating under a new contract must be allowed before formal project closure can be achieved. An independent assurance review to assess delivery of benefits was undertaken in Autumn 2014, enabling formal closure in early 2015.",The programme remains on track.  The Competing Delivery of Services contracts were awarded in November 2014 as per schedule.,"The programme delivered against key milestones, including:
• The transition to the new Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRC) and National Probation Service (NPS) structure on the 1st June,
• The launch of the CRC competition which generated significant levels of market interest from a broad and diverse set of bidders, 
• The award of contracts on 18th December 2014,
• Commencement of the under 12 month provisions for the Offender Rehabilitation Act.

The programme was successfully closed as planned in Mar 2015. All outstanding issues and actions were formally transferred to the business owners responsible for ongoing service delivery. Delivery of benefits against the business case will be tracked within the business areas.","The programme is delivering to schedule. 

In addition to the progress on procurements for improved services, four Regional Resettlement Consortia were launched in November 2014, alongside an innovative partnership with employers to provide work placement on-release (the Turnaround to Work initiative).

The programme is now focused on 
• Successful mobilisation of the new YOI Education Provision alongside wider improvements to the operation of YOIs ,
• Finalising arrangements to build the Secure College Pathfinder and to run a competition for the operator.","The desktop solution has been the Modernisation Programme's focus in 2013 and 2014; whilst achieving the ICT changes to support the NCA's formation in 2013. The Virtual Desktop Pilot was successful, with Roll-out in Q1/2015, followed by the physical devices scheduled to be deployed through Q3/2015, with the Full Business Case (FBC) protected by trading some Supplier obligations out for a more mobile solution for the NCA’s benefit. The Programme is still tightly controlled by the Authority and on track to achieve the FBC savings of £213m over 10 years."," Following the ICT Modernisation Correction Plan’s re-base lining and Contract change approval in December 2014, the ICT Modernisation Tranche 2 has been profiled for final decommissioning of legacy Gateways equipment by 20/07/2017, which will be the end deliverables.",Project closed on schedule in June 2014. Exit review activities have commenced as planned.,"The Programme continued as scheduled and formally closed on 1st October 2014, exiting GMPP.",Phase 1 completed as planned. Phase 2 on schedule.,Phase 1 was delivered as per plan and the project has exited GMPP.,"Schedule on track, with the build of the application progressing according to plan. 
The technical platform release to support the Monthly Wages and Salaries Surveys pilot went live on 5 September, as planned. ","Schedule on track. Blue Book 2014 was published on 31st October as planned.

"Departmental narrative on  budget/forecast variance for 2014/15
(if variance is more than 5%)",n/a,n/a,There has not been the increased take up in the second year of delivery as anticipated. Due to this budgets and forecasts have reduced significantly during 2014-15.,The project will spend less than originally forecast in 2014/15 due to the Ministerial decision not to proceed with the sale this year.,"14/15 forecast represents the estimated cost of administering the sales process, including use of expert advisers for the FY14/15 year.",n/a,n/a,Budget variance less than 5%,Budget variance less than 5%,Variance above is due to planned over programming by the Programme Team. This reflects the maturity of the Programme and ensures better financial management of delivery partners. We have undergone a mid year review of finances in November and we now forecast that our total outturn for FY 14/15 will be £207.63m. This is a varaince of 1% from 14/15 budget.  £2m of the projected underspend was rolled over at mid-year for use in the final year of the programme. ,Budget variance less than 5%,Budget variance less than 5%,Budget variance less than 5%,Budget variance less than 5%,Original budget estimates for 2014/15 included the annual cost of in-house auditors.  From 2013/14 in-house Audit Commission audit staff transferred to the private sector audit firms that won the outsourcing contracts. The 73% reduction between 2014/15 budget and forecast is a result of this in-house audit work now being undertaken by the private sector as well as savings achieved by the Commission no longer carrying out Comprehensive Area Assessment and Inspection since 2010 ,"This data was correct at Q2.

The Phase 1 Superfast Broadband Programme remains broadly on budget in line with delivery. Grant funding is provided based on the completion and costs of achieving agreed milestones. Costs have been lower than expected which has resulted in the minor variance in forecast against budget.

","This data was correct at Q2.
The MIP forecast represents that funding is provided in arrears on evidence of delivery.

Capital Expenditure for 2013/14 relates to the Digital project which was responsible for the delivery of the IT and Digital services. The budget was substantially higher for the financial year 2014/15 because this is when IER went live across England, Wales and Scotland.

","The whole life cost for EMR now includes the estimated support costs for both Contracts for Difference and Capacity Market, resulting in a significant increase compared to earlier estimates, which only included expenditure that is not levy funded. £47,226.29m of the whole life cost is gross Levy Control Framework and levy funded expenditure. The whole life cost includes the estimated cost of CfD support payments within the agreed Levy Control Framework cap of £7.6 billion up to 2020/21, which covers all DECC’s low-carbon electricity levy-funded policies (i.e. CfD, Renewables Obligation, small-scale Feed-in Tariffs and investment contracts). For the Capacity Market, the estimated gross costs are based on an assumption of annual capacity auctions for the duration of state aid approval for the policy (i.e. until 2024/25) but ignore the approximately equivalent savings we forecast from a lower wholesale price. These assumptions are based on our latest view of how EMR will be delivered, and the most recent DECC modelling that informed the Energy and Emissions Projections publication in November 2014.

These comprise the Renewables Obligation, small-scale Feed-in Tariffs and Contracts for Differences (including Investment Contracts). The annual cap in 2020/21 has been set at £7.6 billion, a level which will enable us to meet our low carbon and renewables ambitions. The overall costs of all DECC’s low carbon electricity levy-funded policies has not previously been included in the published WLC of this programme, and in this case accounts for £22,481.72m of the WLC.

Note that the costs reported here only cover costs related to a GDF for legacy waste and waste arising from the existing fleet of nuclear reactors, it does not include any provisions for waste disposal from a new nuclear build programme. The WLC figure is presented in real terms due to the long timescales associated with this project.","The WLC figure consists of:
• All Energy Company Obligation (ECO) costs (average cost scenario) to be borne by energy suppliers as detailed in The Future of the Energy Company Obligation Impact Assessment (22/7/2014) 
• Private Rental Sector (PRS) costs (those for landlords). This calculation is based on the estimated costs from the published consultation stage Impact Assessment (IA). 
• Government expenditure, including resource, running and administration costs; as well as capital costs including Green Deal Home Improvement Fund (GDHIF) and Green Deal Communities (GDC) funding, and Green Deal Finance Company (GDFC) investment costs. These figures represent allocated budget, not actual spend.

They also cover the costs of processing and managing the resultant radioactive and non radioactive wastes arising from decommissioning activities. Finally the WLC address the establishment of a ""hub"" facility to carry out surveillance, and if required maintenance ops on the sites after they enter their C&M states.
The WLC figure is calculated in nominal terms. ","RHI budgets are only set up to 2015/16 so WLC (which run to 2040) is illustrative only and assume smooth scheme deployment growth up to 2020. This reflects both the domestic and non-domestic RHI, with non-domestic RHI costs lasting 20 years and domestic costs lasting 7 years. 

As RHI cost estimates run to 2040 inflation estimates have a very large impact.

The total for that period included in the bid for the A14 was £1.489bn and will not change.  The Highways England funded development costs for 2013/14 and 2014/15 from within its SR10 funding allocation, from savings across the portfolio.",Cost included in the whole life cost is the expected capital of the Crossrail programme excluding rolling stock and depot contract,"The 2013 Spending Round provided the long term certainty required to build HS2 by setting a funding envelope of £42.6 billion (in 2011 prices excluding VAT). This provided a clear funding envelope within which the Government will aim to deliver HS2. In order to ensure the project can start construction in the next Parliament, the Government has set a detailed budget for HS2 from 2015-16 to 2020-21 of over £16 billion.
The Government has learned from the successful delivery of the London 2012 Olympic Games, and is setting a cost control framework to ensure the project remains affordable to the nation over the coming two decades. Sir David Higgins' first report ‘HS2 Plus’, published in March 2014, confirmed that the cost estimates for constructing Phase One are right and that any savings should be used to protect the contingency at this early stage.

It was forecast a cost of work done in Phase 1 of £3.5m, which included: costs of employing a Programme Director and support; professional PMO support; admin support; delivery of the Nationally Consistent Assurance Process and validation of this process; assessment of Fast Track plans; support to 6 Fast Track plans; meta-analysis of data; plan improvement support; local government networks. The actual cost of Phase 1 was £3.86m. 
The scope for Phase 2, running from 31st October to 31st March, was still being developed in detail in Q2 and dependent on 1) An understanding of the number of areas whose plans are approved with conditions, approved with support or not approved in September as this will impact the shape and size of any Task Force provided support in Phase 2 2) The feedback from Programme Board and Stakeholders over the coming weeks as the scope for Phase 2 is socialised with them. The costs included all those for Phase 1 less the local government networks and also including Better Care Advisors and events.  
The Taskforce was forecast a final cost of work done for Phase 1 and Phase 2 of £5.38m at the end of March 2015 in Q2. 
The current forecast in Q4 is £6.13m: an additional budget amount of £778,197.00 was repurposed from identified SCLGCP savings in October and the updated budget situation was noted by the BCF Programme Board on the 14th October 2014. It was agreed at the Programme Board on the 14th of October that Plan Implementation Support would be procured to support areas with the implementation of their plans, this support is being funded (approx £1.2m) and procured via NHS England and is not included in the Taskforce's full life costs.

• Specific recruitment, retention and training initiatives in addition to MPET-funded activity to support workforce expansion and service transformation.
• Delivering the marketing strategy.

The total budgeted whole life costs have remained stable and are thought to be accurate at this point. It should be noted that the total budgeted whole life cost stated in the previous Transparency Report did not include the cumulative costs of expanding the health visitor workforce and was therefore lower than the costs stated in this report.

Whole Life Costs include the funding for costs relating to the Chinook Mk 6 Programme up to the end of manufacture, but exclude in-service support costs.",The WLC reflect the total of all relevant projects up to the end of the Manufacture phase at this current time. The growth in funding relates to the inclusion of new project funding within the pipeline in the second & third decade.,"This cost represents the current approved baseline cost which includes:  regenerating and sustaining the core production capability, personnel, training, plant, equipment and raw materials, and development and manufacture of cores.

The cost is expected to increase, subject to approval, due to the change of requirement as above. This cost includes the additional material, resources and dual running of the facilities required to manufacture the additional cores.",Budget and forecast subject to realignment to new governance arrangements.,Exempt under section 43 of the Freedom of Information Act (2000),Exempt under section 26 of the Freedom of Information Act (2000),Forecast being defined in line with delivery priorities and programme sequencing. ,DII's cost of ownership within programmed approvals. ,No significant change.

There has been technical adjustment to the way costs are reported, resulting in an apparent reduction in costs since Q2 2013/14.  Budgeted Whole Life Costs are now reported out to the end of manufacture rather than up to the out of service date. It should be noted that planned expenditure is continually subject to review as the cost model matures through the System Development and Demonstration phase of the US Joint Strike Force (JSF) Programme.",At the time of the submission the total budgeted whole life cost did not meet the forecasted requirement to deliver the transformation (£897m). The variance is mainly in 2015/16 and 2016/17 and relates to additional implementation costs such as rebrigrading incurred during transition. As part of the Main Gate Business Case approval process the MOD Defence Board approved the additional expenditure required. The case estimated total savings of £0.5bn over the 13 year life of the contract. ,Budgeted Whole Life Costs are different this report from Q2 13/14 due to a change in the way these costs are reported. Previously the Whole Life Costs included all forecast costs to planned out of service date for the ships. This report reflects the costs up to delivery into service of all four ships and the initial support package as approved in the main investment decision business case. ,Current forecast is in line with original Main Gate Business Case approvals,"The Whole Life Cost includes the introduction of those avionic systems needed to address obsolescence issues, as well as the necessary support products and training requirements. The latest revised figure includes the incorporation of additional capability enhancement measures.","The increase of the total budgeted whole life costs from Q2 2013 is caused by the funding profiles being amended to include all costs out to the end of manufacture. This has predominantly seen additional costs added to Future Years (Yr 10+).  Costs reported in Q2 2014 are associated with procurement of vehicles, their whole life costs, training simulators and a 1-2 year initial support package.  The CT does not currently include other Defence Line of Development costs, specifically Infrastructure and Training.  These will be identified and resourced during the next annual budgeting cycle to provide a complete picture.",The reduction in Whole Life costs is due to the prior year planning round being based on the previous contract costs for the Regional Prime Contracts. The current planning round reflects the new firm price contract values. ,The budgeted whole life cost equates to the NEM Annual Budgeted Cycle (ABC) 14 bid and can be broken-down as follows: Defence Business Services (DBS) Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) change programme costs £45m; Programme Office & Project Team costs £11.30m; DBS Implementation costs £6.42m & Technical support £4m.

Forecast over the year has come down.","The increase in whole life costs since Q2 2013/14 was due to the subsequent inclusion of costs associated with multiple Defence Lines Of Development (DLOD): for example Support and Infrastructure expenditure.  This aligns with the recent Defence Operating Model FOC instruction to capture programmes’ costs cross-DLOD.  There was no material change to the build cost. Work continues to define the In-Service Support Solution for both spares and the maintenance routine post 2023, resource allocation for items such as spares is being reassessed and spares availability reviewed to establish accurate whole life costs.","The forecast whole life cost for SFU, as presented in the re-approval business case, fall within the budgeted whole life costs above.","The budgeted whole life costs include the operating costs of the Defence Infrastructure Governing Authority (DIGA) and the fixed fees payable to the Strategic Business Partner (SBP) appointed to manage Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) over the duration of the contract.

The Fast Air Support Team is working closely with BAES to produce a Future State Operating Model.  This will create mutually agreed efficiencies in order to achieve budget forecasts and to provide programme financial headroom for future platform development.  There has been a reduction in costs since Q2 2013/14 which is due to the reporting horizon now being aligned to the ‘end of manufacture’; FOREX adjustments to Tranche 2 and 3 CTs, both US$ and EURO; Retirement of Risk Inside Costing; and, the McKinsey Flying Hours work.

Costs are based on a mix of Firm Price Elements (£1145.36M) and an estimate (risk assessed) for the completion of programme activities (£22.2M). Changes since Q2 2013/14 are attributable to the deferred deployment of Watchkeeper to Afghanistan, where activities required re-profiling.

This is a combination of reduced White Fleet costs to the programme due to White Fleet being able to absorb current and forecast levels of Whole Fleet Management based activity within their existing budget and  a reduction in Fleet Management manpower costs due to the reduced overall storage requirement over the remaining life of the programme.,"This programme is now complete.  The total programme costs are lower than the business case (budget) by £18.7m. This is a result of lower than anticipated dilapidations and staff exit costs of approximately £5m, lower ICT costs of approximately £1m, and reduced enabling work costs of approximately £12m.
