The Replacement Analytical Project has therefore been initiated to deliver future analytical capability to the Sellafield site, through a major modification of the National Nuclear Laboratory Central Laboratory.  Key modifications are provision of standalone Highly Active (HA), Medium Active (MA) and Special Nuclear Material (SNM) analytical capability.  A key part of the scope is the delivery of 135 Analytical Instruments which will perform the ongoing analysis required by facilities at Sellafield.  Analytical Services remains essential to the delivery of high hazard reduction and remediation until the completion of the Sellafield Ltd mission.","The Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating is Amber.This is primarily due to the following factors: The project is made up of a number of workstreams the last of which is due to complete the preliminary design phase in July 21.

Our intent for the Space Based PNT Programme is to improve the resilience of UK Critical National Infrastructure by having the right space-based capability to deliver PNT services in order to protect our way of life and to address the rapidly evolving global threat and hazards landscape.
We will consider the broadest set of options for space -based PNT whilst using the breadth of the Government's experience of major programmes to provide critical analysis of emerging candidate solutions.

Currently, all trains travelling up the Brighton Main Line to either London Victoria or London Bridge and the Thameslink route through the city must pass through East Croydon station and the flat, partially grade separated junction at the Selhurst triangle north of East Croydon. This constraint imposes inefficient train pathing and operations. Trains waiting in stations are held at red signals across the area, waiting to pass through the junction, leading to high levels of delays and impacting services.

Although the Baseline Forecast Budget from Q2 19/20 ≈Å6288.953m to Q4 20/21 ≈Å6353.940m appears to increase by ≈Å64.987 this is because historic budgets are not adjusted as Programme costs and budgets are rolled forward into future years.

The new institution will operate through the wholesale markets in order to unlock institutional investment to benefit small to medium sized businesses; it will not have any retail presence. Rather, it will facilitate the provision of loans, including long-term patient capital, to UK firms through banks and other financial institutions. The 'Business Bank' will be the single public identity and centre of expertise in government on all commercially-minded finance schemes for small and mid-sized businesses. These services will be managed as a single portfolio with operational and budget flexibility.

The Civil Service Reform Plan sets out a series of specific and priority actions to tackle long-standing weaknesses, build on existing strengths, and address the frustrations expressed by Ministers, civil servants and the public alike.  
The Plan sets out the priorities for action now √Ç¬ñ and is the first stage of the continuing programme of reform. ","From September 2013, the programme moved into tranche 2. The CSR Team undertook a process review over the summer to inform its approach to tranche 2, identifying areas for improvement and change, as we move into the different phase. Changes include: refining the governance, streamlining reporting processes prioritising programme effort and resources  accordingly, a new focus on departmental realisation of benefits and improving programme-wide risk and issues management. 

At a Programme level Civil Service Reform has had a number of key achievements since Q1, including the successful launch of the One Year On report and the √Ç¬ëBe Exceptional√Ç¬í Civil Service Live event, both in July. Also in this period a number of the Programme√Ç¬ís component Actions have moved through the Project Lifecycle to closure or are being embedded and translated into outcomes in Q2 .Further key milestones that have been achieved this quarter have been the completion of the first tranche of the Commissioning Academy, introduction of the CS High Potential Scheme, publication of the first edition of Civil Service Quarterly, launch of the Open Policy Making website in Beta, and the announcement of a new Commercial Model for government.

There will be an element of 'confirmation' during the transition stage.

To deliver this commitment, DECC will enter into discussions with relevant developers with a view to considering what form of comfort might be given to support the taking of such investment decisions.  The FID Enabling project gives effect to this commitment.

By providing an appropriate form of comfort in advance of the implementation of EMR reforms, we are likely to encourage final investment decisions to come forward that would otherwise have been delayed until all necessary legislation had been enacted and new institutional arrangements put in place; or possibly cancelled altogether.  This supports the Government√Ç¬ís decarbonisation and security of supply objectives as well as stimulating investment which creates jobs and growth.  

The first developer to seek assurance through the FID Enabling project, and whom we have accepted meet the criteria, is New Nuclear Build Generation (NNBG), a subsidiary created by EDF Energy to build a new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point C. NNBG will not move to a final decision to proceed with construction in the absence of additional certainty on expected revenue in the reformed market. A delay until the enduring regime is in place could substantially increase costs (ultimately principally borne by the consumer) or result in EDF abandoning the project.

The FID Enabling project gives effect to this commitment.

The aim of FID Enabling for Renewables is to avert an investment hiatus in the deployment of renewable electricity generation caused by the announced reform of the electricity market, in the period between the publication of the EMR White Paper and the full implementation of the EMR CfD, expected in Autumn 2014.   In particular it seeks to enable developers to take final investment decisions, or other critical investment decisions directly impacting on the time to commission the project, which would otherwise be delayed by the uncertainty caused by the transition to the enduring CfD regime.

The project aims are as for the EMR CfD: to ensure that the UK can attract the investment in renewable electricity generation needed to meet its renewable and carbon emission reduction targets in the most cost-effective way as well as to have a secure, affordable, supply of electricity towards the end of this decade and in the longer-term.

The information presented in this return in respect of the new siting programme - particularly the milestones -  is indicative and therefore subject to revision and confirmation.

","The Amber RAG rating reflects the early stages of a long-term project that involves working in partnership with communities. In January 2013 the siting process in west Cumbria came to a close. Since then DECC has been developing a revised siting process, including a lessons learned exercise from the previous process, a Call for Evidence and subsequent public consultation. The revised siting process will be set out by Government in a revised White Paper later this year.
",30/06/2008,31/12/2040,"The programme commenced following publication of the Managing Radioactive Waste Safely (MRWS) White Paper in June 2008. Under original plans, first waste deposited on site was expected by 2040. However, on 30 January 2013, three local councils in west Cumbria (the only communities engaged at that time in the MRWS process) voted on further participation in the siting process for a GDF. In the absence of a positive vote at both Borough and County level - an agreed pre-requisite for the process to continue in west Cumbria - the process in west Cumbria has been brought to a close. The department is learning lessons from the experience in west Cumbria and is engaged in developing a new siting process including a public consultation which ran between 12 October - 5 December 2013.

703,Thames Tideway Tunnel,DEFRA,Amber/Red,"The Thames Tideway Tunnel project aims to underwrite the extreme risks which may arise during the building by the private sector of a new sewage tunnel under London.  
Population growth, increased urbanisation and changes in rainfall patterns mean that London√Ç¬ís sewerage system, largely built in the late 19th century, is operating close to capacity and as a result discharges of sewage to the Thames are occurring regularly and not just as exceptional events. This is unacceptable on environment and health grounds. The proposed Thames Tideway Tunnel is the most cost effective, comprehensive and timely solution to address the problem of combined sewer overflows into the Thames in London, and is due for completion in 2023. In principle the duty to build the ƒπ¬Å4.1 - 4.2bn Thames Tideway Tunnel falls to Thames Water (who lead the project) and oversight of customer interests falls to Ofwat. As lead Department, Defra is responsible for the regulatory regime for the water sector and is exposed to the risk of fines arising from an ECJ (Court of Justice of the EU) case, which has found the UK in breach of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive in London. If the project requires some form of  government support to enable the capital markets to finance the Tunnel then Defra is the lead Department to manage the risks to the taxpayer. Defra is working with Ofwat, Infrastructure UK and HM Treasury to ensure the costs of this large and complex project are minimised and it is delivered with a structure and financing mechanism that delivers value for money for Thames Water customers and UK taxpayers.","The Amber/Red rating reflects the high level of risk  inherent in a project of this type.

It forms part of  the Environment Agency√Ç¬ís Thames Estuary 2100 (TE2100) Plan which provides a strategy for protecting London and the Thames Estuary from tidal flooding to the year 2100 and beyond.  This is work to maintain and improve the existing system of flood defences, including the Thames Barrier and associated gates. The cost of maintaining and improving these defences is justified by the high value of assets protected, with  ƒπ¬Å200bn of property at risk.  
The TE2100 plan sets out the Environment Agency√Ç¬ís short-, medium- and long-term programmes of investments and other recommended actions to manage tidal flood risk through to the end of this century and into the 22nd century.  The Plan is based on a managed, adaptive approach which ensures that the right investments are made at the right time allowing for adjustments to be made in timing of works on the actual impacts of climate change.  The TE2100 Strategic Outline Programme (SOP) describes the delivery of the programme through a number of phases, and was approved by Defra and HMT in 2012. 
Now that the TE2100 SOP has been approved, the focus has moved on to the business case for the first package of works within that strategy - the TEP1 project.

719,High Speed Rail Programme,DfT,Amber/Red,"HS2 is the Government project to build a new North-South railway.  The case for the new line rests on the capacity and connectivity it will provide. We need this capacity because in the future, as our economy and our population grows, we will travel more. We need the connectivity because bringing people together drives economic growth. Our current transport system is already under strain and a constraint on growth. Among the many alternatives that have been considered √Ç¬ñ including new motorways and upgrades to the current rail network - HS2 is the best way of getting ahead of current demand on our core transport network. 

The new north-south railway is a long term solution to a long term problem. Without it the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main Lines are likely to be overwhelmed. With it, we will transform intercity travel, radically improve commuter services into London and our other major cities and increase the amount of rail freight. 

These transport improvements will help support economic growth and make a major contribution towards rebalancing the economy.
The new railway will be built in two phases. It will be fully integrated with the rest of the railway network. It will bring benefits to places with stations on the new railway including Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and London; to stations on the classic network like Liverpool, Darlington and Newcastle which will receive high speed services; and to other places on the existing mainlines like Milton Keynes, Rugby and Peterborough which will have better services from released capacity on the existing main lines


  

","HS2 is in excellent shape and has made significant progress since September. The rationale for HS2 was published in the Strategic Case in October; the hybrid Bill was deposited ahead of the published commitment in November;  the High Speed Paving Bill received Royal Assent on 21 November and most recently the Phase1 Bill achieved resounding success at Second Reading with a majority of 452 to 41.  On April 9, 2014 an improved package of compensation measures for property owners along the phase one of the route was announced and on March 21, 2014 the HS2 Growth Task Force published findings and recommendations to the Secretary of State setting out the main challenges the Growth Task Force can see in maximising the benefits from HS2.  In addition, Sir David Higgins is now in place as Chairman and Simon Kirby has been appointed as the new Chief Executive for HS2 Ltd.   
On Communications Strategy:
We appointed a senior level strategic communications advisor to deliver:
√Ç¬ï A short-term communications effort that focused on the Second Reading of the Hybrid Bill;
√Ç¬ï A longer-term campaign plan based on detailed market research (to be developed); and
√Ç¬ï We now have an integrated communications team in place to deliver against this plan.
On Resourcing:
We have made key appointments to senior roles at HS2 Ltd including:
√Ç¬ï Sir David Higgins as Chairman;
√Ç¬ï Simon Kirby as construction CEO; and
√Ç¬ï Patrick O√Ç¬íConnell as interim Programme and Strategy Director
√Ç¬ï Other senior appointments are in train and will be announced soon, including;

o Head of Programme Controls
o Communications Director 


Both DfT and Network Rail have grown their project teams, bringing in the skills required for the next phase of work. 


On timetable:
A timetable has been developed for the passage of the hybrid Bill through Parliament based on our assessment of the number of expected petitions.  We deposited the Bill on time, achieved success at Second Reading and we are now working with Parliamentary authorities to ensure smooth passage of the Bill through parliament.
Contingency plans, based on different scenarios for the progress of the Bill through Parliament, have been developed. 

On transitioning to the next phase:
On 19 November 2013 SoS confirmed that HS2 Ltd will be the delivery agent for Phase 1. Following this decision we have made significant headway in putting in place the people and structures needed to enable construction to start in 2017. 
An integrated Programme Management Office is being created under the responsibility of the new HS2 Ltd Programme & Strategy Director. This will cover all aspects of the programme including DfT, HS2 Ltd and Network Rail. 
An initial draft of the Outline Procurement Strategy (OPS) for Phase 1 has been developed. Our strategy for supply chain management includes ongoing engagement with industry. The first HS2 Supply Chain Conference in Birmingham in November 2013 set out our OPS to the supply chain.
A programme of work is underway to get ready for construction. A Baseline Programme is in place (Baseline 3) and the HS2 Phase 1 Programme Execution Plan (PEP) has been initiated to define scope and identify key inputs to the document. A critical path for Rolling Stock procurement has been developed to ensure alignment with the programme.

731,Rotavirus Immunisation Programme,DoH,Green,"Background:  Rotavirus infection is the commonest cause of gastroenteritis in children under five years of age worldwide.   Rotavirus infection in the UK is seasonal, occurring mostly in winter and early spring.  In England and Wales an estimated 130,000 episodes of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis occur each year in children less than five years and approximately 12,700 of these children are hospitalised.  In 2011, following consideration of a peer-reviewed modelling study, JCVI advised that the licensed rotavirus vaccines would have a significant impact on reducing gastroenteritis in young children, and that the Department should introduce a rotavirus immunisation programme if the vaccines could be procured at a cost effective price.  Following negotiations with the manufacturer, the price paid for rotavirus vaccine resulted in the vaccination programme being cost effective.  The Department of Health has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution, to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective.
Objective:   The overarching objective of the rotavirus immunisation programme is the reduction of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis in England.   
Scope:  The scope of the project is limited to England and includes all the elements required to successfully deliver a rotavirus vaccination programme.  
Benefits:  The programme will deliver: (1) rotavirus immunisation for babies added to the national immunisation schedule; (2) a reduction of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis; and (3) a reduction on the burden on the NHS by reducing hospital admissions and visits to GPs caused by rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis.
 Rotavirus immunisation has been introduced as part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule from 1 July 2013 and is being delivered via GPs alongside the other vaccines for infants.

733,Shingles Immunisation Programme,DoH,Amber/Green,"Background:  Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the chicken pox virus in a person with a dormant chicken pox infection.  It is not known what causes the virus to reactivate but this is usually associated with those with a suppressed or less effective immune systems.   Shingles incidence is highest in older people as the incidence of shingles increases with age; in the UK it is estimated to be around 790 to 880 cases per 100,000 people, an estimated 30,000 cases of shingles per year for people aged 70 √Ç¬ñ 79 each year.  In 2010, JCVI advised that a universal shingles programme should be implemented for people aged 70 years and up to 79 years inclusive if a licensed vaccine was available at a cost effective price.  The Department of Health (DH) has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution, to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective.  Shingles vaccination will be introduced as part of the arrangements for delivering routine immunisations to adults. NHS England will be responsible for commissioning these services and will need to decide on the most appropriate arrangements for securing delivery as per the service specifications supplied by Public Health England (PHE).
Objective:  The overarching objective of a shingles vaccination programme is the reduction of shingles and associated sequaelae in England.
Scope:  The scope of the project is limited to England and includes all the elements required to successfully deliver a shingles vaccination and catch up programme.
Benefits:  The programme will deliver: (1) sustained improvements in public health; (2) a reduction in burden on the NHS by reducing the need for treatment and (3) a cost effective health intervention.
Maturity:  The Shingles vaccination will be introduced as part of the arrangements for delivering routine immunisations to adults.  The indicative start date for the programme is 1 September 2013, with the vaccine being given alongside the seasonal flu vaccine for the routine 70 year old cohort.   There will also be an annual catch-up programme offered to specified co-horts, commencing with 79 year olds in year 1 of the programme, 78 year olds in year 2, 77 year olds in year 3 etc. This pattern will continue until those eligible for the vaccine between 70 √Ç¬ñ 79 are offered the vaccine.

Services are centrally funded and are currently free to NHS Organisations at point of use.

NHSmail is a fully operational and successful programme. Demand for this service remains strong. High user satisfaction ratings and strong support from the National Stakeholder Engagement Group and National NHSmail Forum suggests a desire to continue a secure email service for the NHS in some form. The continuation of a need, along with a number of other key infrastructure projects, was confirmed in a DH announcement on 22nd September 2011.

","PSNH was rated RED Delivery Confidence at MPA Gateway 2 Review. While progress has been made against the recommendations, Delivery Confidence remained RED due to the dependency upon the N3 programme to achieve extension.
N3 Delivery Confidence was RED as the extension business case has failed to gain approval. Any approval to spend from 1st April for N3 became contingent upon moving into the termination period provided for in the contract and agreeing a revised commercial position with BT.
In addition, a clear agreement on future strategic intent was needed before the approval for N3 could be granted.
To ensure PSNH can deliver successfully, continuity of service for the current N3 was  necessary, to enable the requisite time for procurement and implementation. Therefore, due to N3 having a Delivery Confidence of RED for the current service and the delivery of the revised business case, PSNH Delivery Confidence was also stated as RED.
N3 has subsequently moved into transition and funding has been approved. Agreement on the future strategic intent for health and care networking has also been agreed with the Cabinet Office as part of the approval; the PSNH programme is now working to achieve the commitments made by the end of June 2014.

This fits with the strategic aims and objectives (offender rehabilitation to support reduced offending, and improved health and wellbeing outcomes) of each of the departments involved.  It is accepted by the Coalition Government that this direction of travel supports the business needs, as it was anticipated that early intervention and investment in health services for offenders across England will save money through reduced ongoing impacts on the criminal justice system.

752,Seasonal Flu Extension to Children Programme,DoH,Amber/Red,"Influenza is a viral infection of the respiratory system.  For some people, especially older people, young infants and people with underlying health conditions, it can cause serious even life-threatening complications and death. The impact of influenza on the population varies widely from year to year due to changes in the virus. However, one recent estimate considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisations (JCVI) suggest that each year, on average, approximately 0.75 million people may consult their GP, approximately 27, 000 people may be hospitalised and 4, 700 people may die in England because of influenza. Currently the programme provides influenza vaccination on the NHS for people aged 65 years and older and those aged under 65 with certain underlying health conditions (e.g. those with chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, pregnant women etc). 

JCVI has recommended that the current flu programme is extended to children aged 2 to less than 17 years. DH has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution , to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective. The evidence reviewed by JCVI suggests that the extension to the current seasonal flu programme might result in around a 40% reduction in the death and hospitalisation figures shown above across the population, although there is large uncertainty either way in this estimate.  For this reason, JCVI recommends that the impact and cost effectiveness of the extended programme be reviewed within five years of the introduction to assess whether the expected benefits have been realised.

When fully introduced this will be the largest immunisation programme offered in the UK, offering vaccine to more than 9 million children every autumn.  The programme is therefore being phased in to allow time to build up capacity and adopt learning from early pilots.

","Following the MPA Delivery Confidence Assessment rating of Amber/Red, a detailed Management Action Plan was developed in consultation with the key Programme stakeholders which identified specific actions to be taken to address the findings from the MPA Review. 
Due to the complexity and unique nature of the Programme, targeted actions were implemented leading to: 

1. Changes in the leadership and governance arrangements for the Programme to enhance the overall robustness by supporting the delivery and effective management of the current phase which largely involves procurement of the equipment, assurance and securing the necessary Government approvals. 
2. A revamp of the Programme environment providing clarity to where accountability and responsibilities lies at the various tiers of the National Programme, for example, 

o DH is providing leadership and responsible for:
i. Capital Funding
ii. Programme management and delivery
iii. Approvals and assurance using mandatory Cabinet Office and HM Treasury processes.

i. Commissioning
ii. Clinical Services and Referrals
iii. Mobilisation of PBT Services
iv. Clinical Policy development
v. Benefits Management and Realisation
vi. Engagement with key stakeholders including the Devolved Nations and professional organisations
vii. Research and Development. 

3. Improvements in the resource levels including confirmation of the core Programme team and use of subject matter experts in specific areas such as the role of a national clinical lead for PBT, workforce strategy and development, and communications.
4. Structured and coordinated stakeholder engagement √Ç¬ñ in particular, the establishment of a National PBT Special Interest Group (SIG) with the active participation of the relevant Clinical Reference Groups (CRGs); Health Education England (HEE); professional organisations such as The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR), The Society and College of Radiographers (SCoR), Institute for Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM). In addition, the Programme also has access to the expertise of specialists in the related fields relevant to developing a national PBT service in England. 

Early work has commenced to develop a national plan for the clinical management of patients who have been clinically assessed to benefit from PBT treatment. Part of this work involves the review and expansion of the clinical indications list via the new NHS England processes through the development of clinical policies by engaging with the relevant CRGs as a longer term strategy for the viability of a National PBT service. 
The culmination of these actions has put the Programme on a much improved pedestal in terms of governance, resources, communications, stakeholder engagement and the plans towards the delivery of sustainable benefits.

NCS brings young people together from different backgrounds (e.g. religious, ethnic and socioeconomic) to work together, and teaches them what it means to be responsible and serve their communities. It is a high quality personal development programme that gives young people a chance to prove to themselves and their peers what they can do.  NCS is part of a broader agenda of improving services and outcomes for young people between the ages of 13-19, reflected in the Positive for Youth policy statement published in December 2011.

NCS builds on a substantial range of previous government initiatives that aim to increase voluntary activity among young people and develop their life and citizenship skills.

√Ç¬ï The creation of a Contract for Difference (CFD) Mechanism which incentivises low carbon technology and generation (renewables, nuclear and CCS) in a cost-effective way;

√Ç¬ï The creation of the Capacity Market Mechanism to ensure that the market has sufficient capacity to ensure security of supply in a cost-effective way; and 

√Ç¬ï Putting in place an institutional framework with sufficient credibility to administer the reforms efficiently and effectively.

902,High Speed Rail Programme,DfT,Amber/Red,"HS2 is the Government project to build a new North-South railway.  The case for the new line rests on the capacity and connectivity it will provide. We need this capacity because our railways are increasingly busy and in the future, as our economy and our population grows, we will travel even more. We need the connectivity because bringing people together drives economic growth. Our current transport system is already under strain and a constraint on growth. Among the many alternatives that have been considered √Ç¬ñ including new motorways and upgrades to the current rail network - HS2 is the best way of getting ahead of current demand on our core transport network. 

The new north-south railway is a long term solution to a long term problem. Without it the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main Lines are likely to be overwhelmed. With it, we will transform intercity travel, radically improve commuter services into London and our other major cities and increase the amount of rail freight. 

These transport improvements will help support economic growth and make a major contribution towards rebalancing the economy.
The new railway will be built in two phases. It will be fully integrated with the rest of the railway network. It will bring benefits to places with stations on the new railway including Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and London; to stations on the classic network like Liverpool, Darlington and Newcastle which will receive high speed services; and to other places on the existing mainlines like Milton Keynes, Rugby and Peterborough which will have better services from released capacity on the existing main lines","The High Speed 2 programme remains in a strong position and continues to make significant progress. 
On Resourcing:
There has been significant progress on building capability in the programme as we transition towards the delivery phase. We have made key appointments to senior roles at DfT and HS2 Ltd including:
√Ç¬ï Simon Kirby, Chief Executive, HS2 Ltd √Ç¬ñ May 2014
√Ç¬ï Alistair Kirk, Programme and Strategy Director, HS2 Ltd √Ç¬ñ September 2014
√Ç¬ï Jonathan Crone, PMO Director, HS2 Ltd - January 2015
DfT and Network Rail and HS2 Ltd have each grown their project teams, bringing in the skills and capability required for the next phase of work.
On Phase 1 Hybrid Bill and timetable:
The hybrid Bill for Phase One (London-West Midlands) was deposited on time and achieved resounding support at its Second Reading in April 2014 with a majority of 452 to 41 demonstrating the strong cross party support for the scheme.  Good progress has been made in hearing petitions and, by March 2015, 344 petitioners had been heard by the Bill Committee and a further 99 petitioners had withdrawn or will not appear on account of agreed changes or assurances received from the Secretary of State, along with 22 who were denied standing by the Committee.  
The Secretary of State announced in Parliament that the working assumption was that the Hybrid Bill would achieve Royal Assent in late 2016. A carry-over motion was successfully passed that will allow the Bill√Ç¬ís work to be carried over into the next Parliament.  The target opening date for Phase 1 remains unchanged for 2026.
On governance and the transition to the next phase:
Governance arrangements have been developed to formalise tripartite working between DfT, HS2 Ltd and Network Rail.  Board structures have been reviewed and the new structures have been operating successfully for some months. 
A Development Agreement was signed by DfT and HS2 Ltd on 8 December 2014 formalising the relationship between DfT and HS2 Ltd in developing and delivering the HS2 railway and associated work.  A new client board, chaired by the SRO, has been put in place to manage the performance of HS2 Ltd against this Development Agreement.
The creation of an integrated Programme Management Office, under the responsibility of the new HS2 Ltd Programme & Strategy Director, is in hand. 
We are making good progress on preparations towards construction:   HS2 Ltd held two further supply chain conferences, in London on 17 October 2014 and in Manchester on 23 October 2014, to discuss the commercial opportunities with the supply chain and inform the procurement strategy and approach for the programme. 
Phase 2 (Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds)
On 27 October 2014 Sir David Higgins released his second report on HS2, √Ç¬ëRebalancing Britain√Ç¬í.  This confirming that the strategic goal for Phase Two linking Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds is right; the East Midlands and South Yorkshire stations are best for the regions and the existing network; a hub station at Crewe would serve the local region and the North West; Leeds station must match the city√Ç¬ís vision and its transport needs; and that work needs to continue on the best route for an East/West connection in the North (√Ç¬ëHS3√Ç¬í), how and when it could be constructed, and its cost. 
In response to Sir David√Ç¬ís report, the Government confirmed its commitment to the Y Network. The programme in now undertaking further work to consider the possibility of expediting the delivery of part of the Phase 2 route and the possibility of a hub station at Crewe.  The Government expects to take decisions on this during 2015.

√Ç¬ï Ministers therefore concluded that, to ensure the sustainability of the care we provide, we have to change our focus from simply treating illnesses, to keeping people well and living independently for as many years as possible and integrate our health and social services.

√Ç¬ï To drive this they have decided to pool budgets between CCGs and Local Authorities to encourage them to work together and drive the integration agenda forward.  

√Ç¬ï Local areas first submitted their BCF plans (detailing how pooled budgets would be planned to be spent in that area) in April 2014. However the quality and aspiration of these plans was not as expected and as a consequence the BCF Task Force was set up on the 7th of July 2014 to work with local areas to improve the quality of plans, assess them and provide assurance to ministers. 

The objective of the policy is to accelerate the local integration of health and care services to deliver better outcomes for patients and service users. 

The Task Force has a narrow focus and its objectives are as follows: 

√Ç¬ï Oversee creation of, assurance and sign off plans across the country which utilise the opportunity of the pooled funds to best effect and support achievement of the purpose;
√Ç¬ï Support the system to prepare for delivery of plans

By the end of October 2014 all 151 plans will have been assessed and assured against the agreed set of national conditions. They will be given an assessed status of either: approved; approved with support; approved with conditions; or not approved.
The assessment and assurance process will seek to deliver plans that will include:
√Ç¬ï A clear analytically driven (i.e. risk stratified) understanding of where care can be improved by integration (of budgets, commissioning, care processes or services)
√Ç¬ï A clear and evidence based plan of action, developed with all local stakeholders (CCG, LA, HWBB, NHSE, acute and non-acute providers and primary care providers)
√Ç¬ï A coherent and believable delivery chain with clear local management and accountability arrangements  
√Ç¬ï A credible way of tracking the impact of interventions, and taking remedial action as necessary
√Ç¬ï P4P mechanisms that are agreed and support delivery of the SR settlement and NHS settlement

Given that not all plans will achieve fully approved status, it has already been proposed and approved by the Task Force Programme Board that the Task Force be extended beyond October to support areas to get their plans to a fully approved state and help areas prepare for April. 

The Task Force is currently scoping this Phase 2 of activity which will run from November 2014 through to March 2015. Phase 2 will include the following objectives: 
√Ç¬ï To have the majority of plans fully approved and ready for implementation
√Ç¬ï To align the BCF plans with BAU NHS and Local Government planning processes
√Ç¬ï Support local areas to prepare for and focus on the delivery of BCF plans
√Ç¬ï Communicate a strong narrative to the public, and health and social care staff on the value of Integrated Care
√Ç¬ï Alignment with other health and social care integration initiatives
√Ç¬ï Prepare for and take part in longer term policy development such as the next spending review

Task Force Phase 2 benefits are still being analysed however they are expected to include the raising of the profile of the integrated care agenda with the public and health and social care staff, and a level of assurance around the strength of the implementation of plans in local areas in preparation for April 1st 2015. 

Post March 2015 there will still be much work to be done in order to release the benefits to patient care that the Better Care Fund aims for. CCGs and Local Authorities are free to use their share of the funding to promote integration as they see fit. However, they should meet some national conditions to ensure a minimum level of consistency throughout England. Conditions include ensuring 7 day health and social care services, preventing unnecessary hospital admissions and reducing delayed transfers of care, to making sure one lead professional is accountable for all of a person√Ç¬ís care throughout the new integrated system. 

It is currently unclear whether post March 2015 work will be overseen and monitored via existing structures within Local Government and the NHS or if there will be some requirement for further work or support from a central team such as the Task Force. 

The current Task Force currently has no scope or remit post March 2015. 

","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Red at Q2 2014.                                     
There were major risks and issues that are apparent in a number of areas around plan submittal and quality and aspirations around plans: 
1) The timescales set for local areas to submit plans which are of the required quality and aspiration are challenging which may lead to the number of plans that are 'not approved' being larger than what was hoped for by many stakeholders
2) The timescales during which the Task Force could provide support to areas was short therefore there was a risk that plans may not substantially change in quality from the previous submission
3) The local settings in which plans were being developed were complex with many and varied stakeholders (social care, local Government, NHS, HWBs, CCGs) and development of a robust and quality plan requires agreement across sectors
All of these issues and risks were actively managed and actions included:
√Ç¬ï Plan improvement support over the summer for local areas included webinars, regional clinics, practical guides and intensive hands on support. 
√Ç¬ï A Governance Structure to feed key decisions was set up and included regular meetings with the SoS Health, a X Ministerial Board and BCF Programme Board. 
√Ç¬ï Three Checkpoints gave some visibility of area readiness to submit plans and the results were fed  into support arrangements, with any changes being made that were appropriate
√Ç¬ï Five Fast Track areas submitted plans at the end of August and were √Ç¬ëapproved with support√Ç¬í via the National Consistent Assurance Review process (NCAR).
√Ç¬ï All remaining BCF plans were submitted and went through the NCAR process, receiving approval statuses. 
√Ç¬ï The Taskforce was extended to continue into Phase 2, running from the end of October to the end of March. The objectives for this phase were to plan and develop the detail for support offerings and assurance for local areas post NCAR results.
Progress to date:
Since Q2, all plans not fully approved in October have been resubmitted following the delivery of support to areas not fully approved: areas in the 'approved' and 'approved with support' categories were mainstreamed into NHS England and LG mechanisms to enable them to progress with implementation. Those areas in the 'approved with conditions√Ç¬í and √Ç¬ënot approved√Ç¬í categories worked with a team of Better Care Advisors and experts from a PA-led consortium to support them to strengthen their plans, break through issues and resubmit plans.
As of 26th January 2015, of 150 plans: 120 have been fully √Ç¬ëApproved√Ç¬í; 4 are categorised as √Ç¬ëApproved with Support√Ç¬í; the remaining 26 plans have been resubmitted and are currently undergoing the Nationally Consistent Assurance Process with a formal outcome on the 6th February. An escalation process is in place for areas who fail to reach either √Ç¬ëApproved√Ç¬í or √Ç¬ëApproved with Support√Ç¬í categories in this final wave of resubmissions. 
A KMPG-led consortia of experts has been engaged to lead implementation support nationally, with support being led regionally by NHS England regional leads with local government colleagues.
The current Taskforce currently has no scope or remit post March 2015 but work is underway to develop plans for a core team, resourced jointly by NHS England, DCLG, DH and LGA, to continue supporting the success of the Better Care Fund centrally. 
",07/07/2014,31/03/2015,"The planned schedule from Q2 has been kept, with additional milestones added as Phase 2 has progressed. Key milestones achieved have been putting in place remedial arrangements and support for areas unable to sign off a plan of sufficient quality/ambition, reviews undertaken for area plans in October and the majority of plans reaching approved status by January 2015.

Phase 2 of the Taskforce was an extension not initially planned for when the TaskForce was first set up. The extension developed in order to allow the TaskForce to fulfil its objectives and coordinate continuing support required by a number of areas facing challenges in submitting plans of the required detail and quality, as well as to ensure that the appropriate implementation support and planning was in place in the run up to April 2015.

The actual cost of Phase 1 was  ¬Å3.86m. 
The scope for Phase 2, running from 31st October to 31st March, was still being developed in detail in Q2 and dependent on 1) An understanding of the number of areas whose plans are approved with conditions, approved with support or not approved in September as this will impact the shape and size of any Task Force provided support in Phase 2 2) The feedback from Programme Board and Stakeholders over the coming weeks as the scope for Phase 2 is socialised with them.

The Programme Board discussed this in detail and were clear about the RAG ratings which were provided for each category.  Once all the ratings were taken together, the overall assessment was Amber/Green:  many of the key points had been addressed in the preparation for FBC approval, based on the OBC approval which was granted in May 2014.  The key areas of higher risk/lower confidence rating related mainly to stakeholder engagement and support (given that the commissioner landscape has changed significantly since commissioners provided the original OBC support letters).  There has been extensive engagement with commissioners through a NHS England Area Team-led Commissioner Oversight Forum to ensure that commissioners are sufficiently engaged with, and involved in, the assumptions relating to activity and income which underpin the Business Case.

This information is brought together at the Health and Social Care Information Centre, where it is anonymised. The information has been invaluable for monitoring the quality of hospital care, for planning NHS services, and for conducting research into new treatments. Whilst we have this type of information for some care provided outside hospitals, there are significant gaps meaning that it is not possible to see a complete picture of the care that individuals receive. NHS England has therefore commissioned a programme on behalf of the NHS, public health and social care services to address these gaps.

In February 2014, NHS England announced a six month extension to the proposed roll out of the care.data programme in order to raise awareness, listen and act on the views of patients, health professionals and key stakeholders, and to discuss both the benefits and risks involved. This enabled time to be taken to raise awareness of the benefits of data sharing for purposes beyond direct care and the safeguards in place to secure patient data and to ensure the public are aware of their choices and are informed on how they can √Ç¬ëopt out√Ç¬í of care.data should they wish to do so. The outcome of the engagement was the message that clarity was required about how personal information would be used, what information would be collected and how patients would be communicated to on their right to √Ç¬ëopt out√Ç¬í.  Additionally, it was clear that consideration should be given to the support required by GP practices to meet the fair processing requirements and successfully communicate these messages to support the introduction of care.data, and to implement care.data through a phased roll-out. The first stage of this phased roll out will take the form of a discovery stage working with up to 250 pathfinder GP practices. This approach will allow NHS England and the Health and Social Care Information Centre to work with a smaller number of GP practices to ensure that the programme understands what is required to support GP practices in meeting fair processing responsibilities and ensure patients are aware of how their data will be used and the choices available to them - this is referred to as the pathfinder stage. The √Ç¬ëpathfinder stage√Ç¬í has been established as a project within the care.data programme, it will provide key information from which the programme team can learn and assess the impact before progression into a wider roll-out.

915,Care and Support Implementation Programme,DoH Non Capital,Amber/Red,"The Care and Support Reform Programme is the most significant and far-reaching programme of reform in adult social care undertaken in over 65 years.  It will have a profound impact on the way the care and support system works, the responsibilities of local government and partners, and the rights, outcomes and experience of people who need care, carers and their families. 

The 'Caring for our future' White Paper published in July 2012 set out a wide ranging set of proposals that provide the framework for transforming care and support including:  refocusing the care system onto prevention and early intervention;  strengthening integration across the care and wider support system; empowering people through transparent information on the quality of the care; supporting communities and neighbourhoods to play a more active role; embedding person-centred care and supporting carers; creating a vibrant, sustainable market to support choice; a commitment to implement a cap on care costs. The new system will promote people√Ç¬ís well-being by enabling them to prevent and postpone the need for care and support, and put them in control of their lives to pursue opportunities, including education and employment, to realise their potential.

The programme supports realisation of the vision for care and support set out in the White Paper by:
√Ç¬ï delivering the legal framework, including the Care Act 2014, regulations and statutory guidance.
√Ç¬ï ensuring that appropriate local government implementation plans are in place for April 2015 and April 2016 milestones and providing assurance on state of readiness.
√Ç¬ï providing national leadership and practical support for implementation, including communications materials, specifications (e.g. data standard and interoperability requirements) and learning and development.

Implementation of the programme occurs in two phases.  Phase 1, introduced from 1 April 2015, will see the implementation of a large number of generally lower-risk reforms that will have the greatest effect on the provision of care and support.  Phase 2 changes, introduced from 1 April 2016 will see the implementation of a smaller number of higher-risk reforms, related to funding of care and support and the creation the cap on care costs. Together these reforms represent a major change programme across 152 local authorities and their partners. ","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Red at Q2 2014.
Because of the complexity of the Programme and the indirect nature of the delivery mechanisms, as well as the separate and inherent risks to local government arising from fiscal constraint, the Delivery Confidence at this point remains as: Amber/Red. The recent rating reflects strong support and commitment across the system, but also the residual challenges to local authorities and risk profile.  The Amber/Red rating reflects greater complexity, uncertainty and the risk of diversion during 2015.
The Programme has made good progress and 2015/16 delivery is now more secure.  The Care Bill achieved Royal Ascent in May 2014 becoming the Care Act 2014, regulations and guidance underpinning the reforms that come into effect in April 2015 were published in October 2014, including agreement of the funding for local government of the new burdens from the changes. The tripartite partnership between DH, LGA and ADASS at the heart of the programme continues to be a strong one and a major asset to the Programme. The partnership with the LGA and ADASS ensures shared ownership and implementation of a programme management approach to assure delivery.  An assurance and implementation support strategy has been agreed that combines oversight, monitoring and assessment at all levels with a commitment to target resources appropriately to tackle risk.  Steps we have taken to address the risk to date risk include the provision of  ¬Å19m direct to local authorities to build programme management capacity and support engagement in assurance,  with  ¬Å4m of funding for local authorities in addition to  ¬Å2.7m provided to establish nine regional delivery partnerships to support local implementation.  We have also made a significant investment in a range of implementation support products that support local authorities and providers to prepare their workforce for the changes and assist communication.

Good progress has been made with implementation of an action plan to address MPA recommendations, as well as in delivering the Programme Plan.  Programme Management  has been strengthened and lessons from Phase 1 are being applied to reduce risk to delivery for Phase 2.  Improvements in the transition from policy development to implementation have been identified and are being applied to Phase 2.  We recognise the risk that the uncertainty caused by the election and Spending Review may undermine efforts to deliver Phase 2, however we are confident that we are developing plans and contingency options to do everything within our control to manage this uncertainty and encourage preparations to allow implementation Phase 2.   ",04/06/2013,01/12/2016,"Phase 1 delivery is on track for 1 April 2015. A LGA / ADASS stocktake survey completed in September 2014 (prior to delivery of key support products and funding) identified that 97% of councils are very or fairly confident that they will be able to deliver the Care Act reforms from April 2015 and confidence increasing on most measures of progress. Delivery of Phase 2 remains on time for introduction of reforms from 1 April 2016.  Whilst the consultation on the 16/17 reforms has been put back from December 2014, a focused and effective consultation early in 2015 will allow the timetable for Phase 2 to stay on track.

We anticipate the forecast / actual spend reported in Q4 will be within 1% variance of budget.  This variance is due to the fact that it does not reflect the funding to local authorities to support them in implementing the Care Act which accounts for approximately a third of the variance.  The majority of grant payments to delivery partners are scheduled for the latter 2 quarters of the year.  Business cases for implementation support products were largely approved between October and December thus this significant area of spend will show in the last quarter.  Additional implementation support to Local Authorities  has been approved since Q2 and Phase 1 of the public awareness campaign has been approved but will not reflect in the figures until the final quarter. ,The costs of the reforms are captured within the impact assessments supporting the White Paper and the draft regulations and guidance published in June 2013 for consultation and in the Funding Reform Impact Assessment published with the draft Care Bill in April 2013. These costs and benefits have been updated to reflect the approved changes in the impact assessment published alongside the regulations and guidance for part 1 of the Care Act that come into effect from 1 April 2015. Figures also capture planned departmental programme spending agreed as part of 2014/15 business planning and projections for future years - which are subject to approval. The costs are quoted in 15/16 prices to be consistent with these impact assessments.,2015.0,,,,
916,Childhood Flu Immunisation Programme,DoH Non Capital,Amber,"Influenza is a viral infection of the respiratory system.  For some people, especially older people, young infants and people with underlying health conditions, it can cause serious even life-threatening complications and death. The impact of influenza on the population varies widely from year to year due to changes in the virus. However, one recent estimate considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) suggest that each year, on average, approximately 0.75 million people may consult their GP, approximately 27,000 people may be hospitalised and 4,700 people may die in England because of influenza. Currently the programme provides influenza vaccination on the NHS for people aged 65 years and older and those aged under 65 with certain underlying health conditions (e.g. those with chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, pregnant women etc). 

JCVI has recommended that the current flu programme is extended to children aged 2 to less than 17 years. DH has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution , to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective. The evidence reviewed by JCVI suggests that the extension to the current seasonal flu programme might result in around a 40% reduction in the death and hospitalisation figures shown above across the population, although there is large uncertainty either way in this estimate.  For this reason, JCVI recommends that the impact and cost effectiveness of the extended programme be reviewed within five years of the introduction to assess whether the expected benefits have been realised.

A new system of scrutiny of deaths to address weaknesses identified by the Shipman Inquiry and more recently among others, the Francis Inquiry into poor care at Mid Staffordshire.  In England and Wales, the introduction of medical examiners into the process will provide independent scrutiny of all deaths not investigated by the coroner.  Medical examiners, appointed by local authorities in England and by local health boards in Wales, will either confirm the cause of death stated by a doctor or refer the death to the coroner for investigation.  For all deaths scrutinised by a medical examiner, the cause of death will be explained to the bereaved and an opportunity offered to raise any concerns, which will be acted upon.   In addition to safeguards for the public, anticipated wider benefits include more accurate certification, better quality of mortality data for service planners, appropriate referral of deaths to the coroner and the ability for doctors and coroners to readily have access to general advice from medical examiners in relation to a particular death.

920,Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) Release 2,DoH Non Capital,Amber,"The Electronic Transmission of Prescriptions Programme is delivering the Electronic Prescription Service which is a national service that has its origins in government policy initiatives from 1998. 

With 1.7 million prescriptions generated every working day in England and a predicted annual rise of 5 per cent, the Electronic Prescription Service provides an alternative means of generating and processing the growing number of prescriptions.  The NHS Electronic Prescription Service enables prescribers, such as GPs and practice nurses, to send prescriptions electronically to a dispenser (such as a community pharmacy or dispensing appliance contractor) of the patient√Ç¬ís choice. Dispensing contractors can subsequently send electronic reimbursement endorsement claims to the NHS Prescription Service. 

The main aims of the Electronic Transmission of Prescriptions programme are:
   o To enable the electronic transmission of prescription data in England between:
         - Prescribers (GP, nurses, supplementary);
         - Dispensing contractors (community pharmacy, dispensing doctors and dispensing appliance contractors); and
         - Reimbursement Agencies (e.g. the Business Services Authority√Ç¬ís NHS Prescription Services).
    o  To facilitate the efficient, convenient and accurate dispensing of medication to patients. The scope of the programme covers all primary  care prescribing and dispensing (excluding Schedule 2 and 3 controlled drugs) and supply of medicines, drugs, appliances and chemical reagents by authorised dispensing contractors. Secondary care prescriptions issued for dispensing in the community are also within scope
    o  To enable the NHS Prescription Service to re-engineer their processes to increase capacity and reduce the unit cost of processing prescriptions.

The Electronic Prescription Service has to date delivered Release 2 Phase 3, which allows patients to nominate a pharmacy of their choice, at which to receive their prescription electronically.  The move to Phase 4 will allow a patient to take their prescription token to any pharmacy for dispensing (as they do with their paper prescription today) with the ability to nominate a specific pharmacy continuing for those patients who prefer the service.

","The MPA RAG rating was Amber at Q2 2014.
The rated delivery confidence is Amber in view of the Programme needing to:
√Ç¬ï Focus on strategic risks and issues;
√Ç¬ï Restrict its Board membership;
√Ç¬ï Establish a Service Manager for the end to end patient experience;
√Ç¬ï Undertake a risk assessment;
√Ç¬ï Delineates deployment from business as usual;
√Ç¬ï Ensure an effective contract management process;
√Ç¬ï Resolve the controlled drugs and nomination issue; and
√Ç¬ï Appoint a Business Change manager.

The move to Phase 4 has been delayed from April 2015  to allow time to undertake a number of key activities to improve delivery confidence. These are to ensure robust business continuity arrangements are in place, implement a more formal arrangement with dispensing system suppliers, a full review of the service model, more robust patient communications, implementation of schedule 2 & 3 controlled drugs, and consideration of providing refresher training to dispensers. A review of the Programme Board structure and other governance arrangements will also be completed.  

The most significant risk remains the outcome of the Home Office / Department of Health's three month public consultation to determine whether Schedule 2 & 3  Controlled Drugs should be brought into scope. The outcome could lead to a requirement for further technical changes.

Drawing on a range of policy instruments, it combines strong national leadership signals with improved institutional and professional regulation; radical transparency on performance; enhanced arrangements for identifying and addressing failure; improved leadership capability focused on safety and compassion; a stronger voice for patients within the care system; support for staff to raise concerns safely; support for staff to manage more effectively the emotional burden of care.  In short, to transform the culture of the health and care system generally and to give patients a more reliable expectation and experience of high quality care.  As a multi-faceted programme at both national and local levels there is no single measure of success, but rather a broad range of indicators √Ç¬ñ clinical outcomes, patient experience, staff attitudes, staffing levels, safety incidents, how well led an organisation is, and how likely the staff would be to recommend it to friends and family among others √Ç¬ñ which combine to give a broad dashboard on quality for individual institutions, care pathways and which combine to give a national picture.  Based on the Nuffield study (see http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/ratings-review ), the Ratings regime under development by CQC will be the key instrument for assessing progress against the multiple impacts that the programme is seeking to achieve.  While we and CQC have commissioned evaluation and research to understand better the impacts of the programme on its broad and complex aims, it is unlikely that these will provide a simple assessment of success for the programme or a moment at which a classical programme could close down the work as completed.

Late delivery of Patient Facing Services and other new subsidiary modules under General Practice System of Choice which is likely to reduce the benefit delivered under the framework in 2014/15;

A key objective of the new framework was to open up the market to smaller, subsidiary suppliers but the introduction of new services was delayed due to deficiencies in suppliers' offerings and a lack of HSCIC capacity to perform assurance activity and requirements definition; and

Authority assurance activity for supplier services is being streamlined and requirements are being re-prioritised as mitigation against further delay.

925,Liaison and Diversion Programme,DoH Non Capital,Amber,"The aim of the Liaison and Diversion programme is to improve health and criminal justice outcomes for offenders (or suspected offenders) with mental health, substance abuse, personality disorder, learning disabilities and other vulnerabilities.  This should be achieved by investing in Liaison and Diversion services to screen, assess and refer offenders at the earliest possible point of the criminal justice system into relevant treatment and support, so that information from assessments is subsequently fed into the criminal justice process and can be used to inform decisions about justice outcomes, charging, prosecution and sentencing.  This fits with the strategic aims and objectives (offender rehabilitation to support reduced offending, and improved health and wellbeing outcomes) of each of the departments involved.  It is accepted by the Coalition Government that this direction of travel supports the business needs, as it was anticipated that early intervention and investment in health services for offenders across England will save money through reduced ongoing impacts on the criminal justice system.  The programme is led within NHS England, which has responsibility for commissioning L&D services. Policy work is being taken forward by a cross government programme, funded through the SR settlement to DH and involving DH, Ministry of Justice and the Home Office, working with NHS England and Public Health England.

 At the last review MPA found that considerable progress had been made and noted a number of key developments.  These included approval by HMT of the OBC and subsequent ministerial announcement about the programme in January 2014, successful achievement of the key milestones to establish the pilots, developing the data strategy and smooth transition of the programme team from DH to NHS England. There was noted to be visibly stronger commitment at all levels to the programme which was assessed to be in good shape, and the review team sensed that the team was much better placed to successfully deliver the policy goals.  Despite the significant degree of challenge and complexity associated with this programme, the review team found that all recommendations from the previous review had been addressed. It was recognised that more work is still required, particularly regarding ICT, workforce planning, communications and stakeholder engagement to ensure that these areas do not negatively impact the chances for successful delivery.  The AAP Review Team noted that if active management attention was paid to them, there was no reason why the delivery confidence rating should not continue to improve further.
In response to recommendations an ICT and data strategy has been produced, and detailed ICT and data requirements are in the process of being developed with the Health and Social Care Information Centre; a workforce planning project has been initiated with Health Education England to validate workforce assumptions, and to address skills and workforce supply issues;  communications and stakeholder engagement have been strengthened with the production of a series of films focusing on service user experiences, which is published on the NHS England website; service user focus groups and a service user committee have also been put in place.

A detailed Management Action Plan was developed in consultation with the key Programme stakeholders which identified specific actions to be taken to address the findings from the MPA.  Due to the complexity and unique nature of the Programme, targeted actions were implemented leading to: 
1. Changes in the leadership and governance arrangements for the Programme to enhance the overall robustness by supporting the delivery and effective management of the current phase which largely involves procurement of the equipment, assurance and securing the necessary Government approvals. 
2. A revamp of the Programme environment providing clarity to where accountability and responsibilities lies at the various tiers of the National Programme, for example: 
A. DH is providing leadership and responsible for:
i. Capital Funding
ii. Programme management and delivery
iii. Approvals and assurance using mandatory Cabinet Office and HM Treasury processes.

i. Commissioning
ii. Clinical Services and Referrals
iii. Mobilisation of PBT Services
iv. Clinical Policy development
v. Benefits Management and Realisation
vi. Engagement with key stakeholders including the Devolved Nations and professional organisations
vii. Research and Development. 
3. Improvements in the resource levels including confirmation of the core Programme team and use of subject matter experts in specific areas such as the role of a National Clinical Lead for PBT, Workforce Strategy and Development, and Communications.
4. Structured and coordinated stakeholder engagement √Ç¬ñ in particular, the establishment of a National PBT Special Interest Group (SIG) with the active participation of the relevant Clinical Reference Groups (CRGs); Health Education England (HEE); professional organisations such as The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR), The Society and College of Radiographers (SCoR), Institute for Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM). In addition, the Programme also has access to the expertise of specialists in the related fields relevant to developing a national PBT service in England. 
Work has been done to develop a national plan for the clinical management of patients who have been clinically assessed to benefit from PBT treatment. Part of this work involves the review and expansion of the clinical indications list via NHS England processes through the development of clinical policies by engaging with the relevant CRGs as a longer term strategy for the viability of a National PBT service.

NHS Choices (www.nhs.uk) is the digital channel for the NHS. It receives over 43m unique visits every month and usage of the site has grown annually since launch. NHS Choices allows users to access comprehensive, clinically valid information on health conditions and information about health and social care services and performance. 

NHS Choices is designed to meet the requirements of those with health or care needs, either directly (e.g. patient or service user) or indirectly (e.g. carer). It will focus on the following objectives responding to core user needs, including:

√Ç¬ï Prevent ill health and promote good health: e.g. I want to improve my health and/or wellbeing or avoid past experiences of poor health;
√Ç¬ï Promote early intervention: e.g. I have a symptom, I need help;
√Ç¬ï Reassure and give confidence: e.g. I have a diagnosis or question related to my care, what do I do;
√Ç¬ï Access to services or treatment: e.g. I need a service, how do I choose and access it; and
√Ç¬ï Motivate: e.g. I have an illness and I am not involved in planning my care.

A programme of transformation is required to develop a service which meets these objectives. The current service has not changed substantively since launch in 2007.  NHS England and the Health and Social Care Information Centre are developing a plan for delivery of this transformation programme as well as a definition of the scope of the minimum viable service.

- splitting the transformation programme from the running of the live service (the minimum viable service);
- leadership of the programme and establishing a permanent Senior Responsible Owner; and
- future direction and funding for the service.

Therefore the NHS Choices programme pathway to a green delivery confidence includes:
- review of the current programme management and governance arrangements;
- appointment of a permanent Senior Responsible Owner for the programme;
- the business justification for funding of the live service for 2015/16 and initial funding of the transformation programme to be approved; and

Services are centrally funded and are currently free to health and care organisation's at point of use.

NHSmail is a fully operational service, for which demand remains strong. High user satisfaction ratings and strong support from the National Stakeholder Engagement Group and National NHSmail Forum suggests a desire to continue a secure email service for the NHS in some form. The continuation of a need, along with a number of other key infrastructure projects, was confirmed in a Department of Health announcement on 22nd September 2011. 

The existing NHSmail contract was executed on 1st July 2004 for a 9 year term; it expired on 30th June 2014 with transition contract arrangements in place through to Mar-15 and further funding to be signed off in the next business case. The currently contracted supplier for this service is Vodafone. 

The aim of the NHSmail 2 project is therefore to identify a solution and replace the existing single NHSmail service by Jun-16 by working with Crown Commercial Service to get a number of secure email providers onto a Managed Email framework which will allow NHSmail to run a further competition to procure a replacement service provider from the framework including an integration service that will ensure that @nhs.net emails are directed to the correct provider, its customer organisations and their individual users; a central directory and government gateway service.

Rotavirus infection in the UK is seasonal, occurring mostly in winter and early spring.   In England and Wales an estimated 130,000 episodes of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis occurred each year prior to the introduction of immunisation in children less than five years old and approximately 12,700 of these children were hospitalised.  In 2011 the Joint Committee on Immunisation and Vaccination (JCVI) advised that the Department of Health should introduce a rotavirus immunisation programme if the vaccine could be procured at a cost effective price.  Following negotiations with the manufacturer, the price paid for rotavirus vaccine resulted in the vaccination programme being cost effective.

945,Shingles Immunisation Programme,DoH Non Capital,Green,"Background:  shingles is caused by the reactivation of the chicken pox virus in a person with a dormant chicken pox infection.  Shingles incidence is highest in older people as the incidence of shingles increases with age. Prior to immunisation being introduced in the UK, there were estimated to be around 790 to 880 cases per 100,000 people, an estimated 30,000 cases of shingles for people aged 70 √Ç¬ñ 79 each year.  In 2010, JCVI advised that a universal shingles programme should be implemented for people aged 70 years to 79 years inclusive if a licensed vaccine was available at a cost effective price.  The Department of Health (DH) has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution, to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective. 
Objective:  The overarching objective of introducing shingles vaccination is the reduction of shingles and associated sequaelae in England.
Scope:  The scope of the project is limited to England and includes all the elements required to successfully deliver a shingles vaccination and catch up programme.
Benefits:  The programme is delivering: (1) sustained improvements in public health; (2) a reduction in burden on the NHS by reducing the need for treatment and (3) a cost effective health intervention.
Status:  shingles vaccination was introduced on 1 September 2013.   In 2013/14 shingles vaccination was offered to 70 year olds (the routine cohort) and 79 year olds (the catch-up cohort). In 2014/15 shingles immunisation is being offered to all those aged 70, 78 and 70. The catch-up programme will be continued progressively in future years so that all people aged 70-79 years are offered shingles vaccination.

When a patient√Ç¬ís Summary Care Record is first created it will contain details of: Medications; Adverse reactions; and, Allergies from the patient's GP record. 

Patients have a choice to opt out of the Summary Care Record at any time and must give permission for clinicians to view their Summary Care Record.

It also includes the development and delivery of an annual software release (Release 15) to update Secondary Uses Systems for the 2015/16 financial year tariffs and rules. 
","The MPA RAG rating was Amber/Red at Q2 2014.
The Programme is progressing towards a positon where there will be confidence in going live by completing the required testing of the solution, progressing contracts for the support of the live service with suppliers to conclusion by mid-February and ensuring the required documentation and processes are in place prior to go-live through the use of Service Acceptance Criteria. These are the key areas where progress is required to enable the service to move into a live environment and the Programme Team is prioritising these actions to ensure go-live is achieved.

The MPA noted the improvement in the  quality and quantity of the resource available to the Programme. Work has also been undertaken over this period to strengthen the governance, planning and commercial aspects of the project. The Amber/Red rating was primarily due to the level of activity still required to enable the February go-live date to be achieved. In particular there was concern around the Service Contracts being completed in time to support the live system.

The two HIGH recommendations of the review relate to a critical path and to contingency arrangements. Work has been undertaken to enhance the programme plan following the revised go-live date, highlighting the revised critical path. In terms of contingency planning options have been reviewed to enable SUS to go-live in the absence of Care Identity Service system going live. Proposals on both these issues have been accepted by the Programme Board and will be key to increased delivery confidence. The two MEDIUM recommendations on programme board composition and on benefits planning are to be addressed in coming months, following transition go-live.

950,Automatic Enrolment Programme,DWP,Amber,"The Automatic Enrolment Programme was established to implement the Government√Ç¬ís workplace pension reforms. The overarching aim of the reforms is to get more people saving more for their retirement. The Programme √Ç¬ëwent live√Ç¬í in October 2012, delivering:   
1) Automatic enrolment - a new duty on employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme; to increase the incentive to remain saving in a pension scheme there is a mandatory employer contribution.
2) The National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) - offers low cost pension provision to individuals on low to moderate earnings and their employers. NEST has a public service obligation to accept any employer who wishes to use it to meet their employer duty. 
3) An employer compliance regime - run by the Pension Regulator to support these measures. 

The implementation period for the Programme is 6 years: employers are being 'staged'  by size, starting with the largest, over the period October 2012 to February 2018; and contributions to pension schemes are being √Ç¬ëphased√Ç¬í in over time to provide a period of adjustment for employers and individuals, with full contributions being paid from October 2018. 
Once fully implemented the Department expects to see around 9 million people newly saving or saving more into a workplace pension, and an increase in pension saving of around  ¬Å11 billion a year.
","Implementation has been successful to date. Over 5 million people automatically enrolled by December 2014 with an opt-out rate averaging less than 10 per cent. Rates of on-time compliance remain very high for those employers who have staged so far, and the Department successfully negotiated high staging volumes in Summer 2014. The Programme remains on course to complete implementation to timetable. 

The Programme√Ç¬ís focus now is to support the circa 1.3 million small and micro employers who begin staging from June 2015. The Department is refining the ways in which it has supported larger employers in order to meet the needs of smaller employers, and to this is:
√Ç¬ï testing variants of its communications channels to identify the most effective means of engagement and of securing timely compliance; 
√Ç¬ï helping payroll providers, advisers and intermediaries to fully support employers; and 
√Ç¬ï working closely with pension scheme providers and other sectors to manage the capacity required to support the delivery of the programme.

These reforms are designed to give greater clarity about the State Pension someone can expect to receive from the Government, address some inequalities in the current system and provide a firm foundation for saving for retirement for people reaching State Pension age from 6 April 2016.

Changes include removing the complexities of the current system by moving to a single state pension set above the level of the basic means tested benefit. This together with abolition of the Savings Credit will provide today√Ç¬ís savers with greater clarity about what they will receive from the State.  It also reduces the number of people reliant on the basic means test. The Department is also abolishing contracting out from defined benefit pension schemes.

972,Volume Crime,HMRC,Green,"HMRC is revising its approach to tackling fraud in the Rule Breakers customer group, increasing the number of criminal investigations and subsequent prosecutions in this group. This approach is called Volume Crime and will: deter rule breakers and potential rule breakers from fraudulent behaviour; enhance the effectiveness of civil interventions by evidencing the downsides of non-compliance; and show HMRC is relentless in pursuit of those who break the rules.  The Volume Crime project aims to significantly increase productivity and resources deployed to criminal investigation. 240 staff years will be deployed as a result of this project in Criminal Investigation and associated Risk and Intelligence Service functions, with prosecution numbers rising through the SR10 period to an additional 1,000 prosecutions delivered per year from 2014/15. The considerable increase in activity in the rule breakers segment increases the perceived risks to potential rule breakers and thus deters individuals from going down the path of tax evasion and therefore an increase in ""voluntary compliance"" due to the deterrent effect.

As a result the Government√Ç¬ís stated ambition for payments to begin by the end of June 2011 was met. Payment volumes started to increase from November 2011, with the scheme moving into full operation during 2012-13. By end Q3 2014/15 (end December 2014) the Scheme had issued payment to the value of c. ¬Å998 million to c.893K (86% of total) policyholders.

In October 2013 the Chancellor announced that the Scheme would not close in 2014 but would remain open until 2015 in order to give people the maximum opportunity to claim their payments. The Treasury and the Scheme continue to work closely together to consider the most effective and efficient ways to trace and pay as many as possible of the remaining policyholders due a payment. 

The project end date shown is subject to Ministerial decision but is included for administrative purposes.
","The Green RAG status reflects the extension of the Scheme to 2015 and that the number of payment issued by the Scheme at the end of Q3 2014/15 has reached  91% for individual policyholders and 81% of group scheme policyholders and continues to slowly increase.    

 Building on the success of the advertising and further tracing work begun in Q3 2013/14, work has continued to try to find the remaining  c160,000  policyholders unpaid at the end of Q2.  Following a successful pilot of the Department for Work and Pension√Ç¬ís letter forwarding service, this has been rolled out where the Scheme holds a National Insurance number, date of birth and address. At  the end of Q3 2014/15,26,000 letters sent the DWP's bulk letter forwarding service had resulted in 9,318 payments.  Success rate monitoring will continue in coming months to ensure cost effectiveness is maintained in future tracing activity.

Progress has been made in reducing the number of the remaining,  most difficult to trace, unpaid policyholders   despite these efforts. Whilst payments will continue, it is expected that, despite these continuing efforts to trace them, c12.8% of the policyholder population will not be found.

The scope of the UK elements of the Programme comprises: delivery of 22 A400M aircraft; a UK In-Service Support Solution; and a UK training solution for aircrew and ground personnel.","The delivery confidence at Q2 FY14/15 reflected the fact that the Programme was entering a critical phase with many time-sensitive activities subject to external international dependencies. Most notably, there was a significant reliance on the six-nation Certification and Qualification Committee (CQC) to sentence the remaining evidence needed in time to support the award of Military Certification which would allow operation of the first aircraft.  Secondly, there was a dependency on Airbus Defence & Space to supply an aircraft of a mature enough standard to pass UK acceptance checks. Finally, aircraft acceptance to provide a 'Day 1' capability was also dependant upon the ability to support flying operations in accordance with engineering maintenance contractual obligations.
More than 20 formal governance meetings were held throughout August and September 2014 in order to carefully manage risks associated with delivery and first operational flight; these included operator level working groups through to a series of executive-level readiness reviews, and meetings with industry. This approach ensured that all support requirements were in place at RAF Brize Norton. The first A400M aircraft (ZM400) arrived at RAF Brize Norton on 17 November 2014 and completed its first training sortie the following day, as planned.
Many key Programme targets had to be achieved to facilitate support for the first aircraft including: the successful Transfer of Title of the Full Flight Simulator and commencement of aircrew training at RAF Brize Norton; UK logistical support declared as 'ready to support'; interim infrastructure works completed; Military certification in place to allow operation of the first aircraft; and the In Service Support Business Case approved with contract signature achieved. ",01/07/1997,31/03/2022,"The forecast end of the programme remains unchanged. Airbus Defence and Space was unable to provide an aircraft that passed the exacting acceptance criteria on schedule to meet the Programme's Capability Milestone 1 (delivery of first aircraft).  This resulted in the Transfer of Title being delayed from September 2014 to November 2014. The aircraft flew to RAF Brize Norton on 17 November 2014 and completed its first training sortie the following day. January 2015 saw Airbus Defence and Space advise OCCAR of a likely revised delivery schedule; this was published formally in February 2015.  The resultant delay to UK A400M aircraft delivery will prevent UK achieving Capability Milestone 2, UK In Service Date (ISD) (planned for March 2015) until September 2015.  The impact of these aircraft delays on subsequent UK milestones can be contained within the revised delivery plan, albeit at increased Programme risk, due to UK Programme Board action to prioritise the builds up of frontline capacity, whilst demanding more efficiency from the UK-specific A400M Defensive Aids modification programme, which is running in parallel with aircraft deliveries.

Challenges within the Equipment, Infrastructure and Logistics Defence Lines Of Development DLOD, were the main drivers leading to the overall delivery confidence assessment.  The Equipment DLOD had two main issues. The first was the inability to reach a decision on a solution to airframe fatigue, leading to contract delay but not yet causing programme slip. The second factor was a possible projected delay to the production of ""Block 3F"" standard software, which is critical to IOC. Since Q2 a solution to the fatigue problem has been identified and agreed, and the likely slip to the software release will not affect IOC. Progress in the Infrastructure DLOD was noted as being slow, however the SRO reported that an adequate scale of infrastructure would be available to enable IOC. Progress has now been made on gaining planning approval for the build, with Permitted Development being approved. The logistics DLOD report was occasioned by the lack of maturity of the through life sustainment plan for the Air System. Since Q2 the Lightning II Sustainment Strategy has been developed. This document lays out clearly what the sustainment strategy is through life and work is progressing through 2015 to better understand sustainment costs and to contract for the initial sustainment contract for RAF Marham. At the programme level the lack of appropriately resourced Programme Management Office was identified as being a Programme Risk, as was the lack of resource available to the DLODs themselves.

The system consists of unmanned air vehicles, sensors, data links, ground control stations and tactical ground vehicles, allowing it to operate from both deployed operating bases and austere air-strips.  Watchkeeper deployed to Afghanistan in 2014, but is still very much in development until Full Operating capability is generated in 2017. ","The capability is still in development and will require considerable further development to reach the Full Operating Capability in 2017.  WATCHKEEPER is a first-of-type Unmanned Air System (UAS) and there is no other bench-mark system to compare progress against. The most significant challenge is the establishment of the training systems and capacity in the UK for this novel capability which will sustain the growth of the capability, whilst simultaneously conducting the test and evaluation of the FOC capability. This will require careful management of the initial small cohort of military and civilian operators and instructors in 2015/16. The other significant challenge will be the development of Boscombe Down airfield to sustain routine WATCHKEEPER operations including the more flexible and efficient use of take-off slots and airspace. This should provide the appropriate governance across the Watchkeepeer stake-holders to generate the momentum and agility required to achieve FOC.   ",01/03/1998,31/12/2042,The programme was re-baselined in June 2014. The first major milestone (Initial Operating Capability) was achieved by deploying the capability to Afghanistan in August 2014 at the Operational Capability Unit (OCU) standard. The next milestone is to generate additional capacity of 4 Task Lines (at the OCU standard) in April 2016.  The main effort is to achieve Full Operating Capability (FOC) Apr-Jul 17 with an uplift of the capability to Equipment Standard 2 (ES2). This will require a major Release to Service (RTS) amendment.  The programme remains on track to achieve these milestones.  Achieving programme milestones remains challenging but the re-balancing process has delivered a taut and achievable timeline. , ¬Å63.37m, ¬Å68.04m, ¬Å1167.56m,The budget figure ( ¬Å63.37M) reflects the WATCHKEEPER annual budget allocation which was set in November  2013. The increase in the forecast against this budget ( ¬Å4.67M) for the current financial year is due to a funding shortfall against the expected contingency (NATO Air Command and Control Management Organisation) funding for the year. ,"Whole life costs currently include the Development, Manufacture, and Initial Support of the Watchkeeper System.√Ç¬† This includes the delivery of Equipment (54 Air vehicles and 15 Ground Control Stations), contractor logistic support, and initial training delivery of Watchkeeper Operators and Maintainers. Costs are based on a mix of Firm Price Elements ( ¬Å1145.36M) and an estimate (risk assessed) for the completion of programme activities ( ¬Å22.2M). Changes since Q2 2013/14 are attributable to the deferred deployment of Watchkeeper to Afghanistan, where activities required re-profiling.

Therefore, we would expect the WLC to vary year on year to reflect changes in the market.  From 2014 to 2015, DECC√Ç¬ís projections of wholesale electricity prices fell, reflecting underlying low fossil fuel prices and a subsequent reduction in DECC√Ç¬ís gas and coal projections.  This resulted in an increase in the whole life costs for Hinkley Point C.
Wholesale prices are volatile and sensitive to a number of uncertain factors including, for example, future global gas price trends, carbon prices, coal prices, the level of intermittent generators in the system and demand trends.  Whereas the strike price agreed for Hinkley Point C is fixed and has been set following extensive negotiations with EDF and with advice from independent expert advisors.

Since Q2 we have made 3 franchise awards- 1 through Direct Award (West Midlands) and 2 following competition (Northern and TransPennine Express (TPE)). These awards will deliver significant benefits for passengers and higher returns to the exchequer. The Northern and TPE franchises will begin 1 April 2016 and work to mobilise them continues. This includes the formation of the joint Rail North/ DfT commercial management teams in Leeds, which will see a more localised approach to the franchises and is a step toward eventual devolution. 
The most recent issue of the franchise schedule included a retiming of the InterCity West Coast competition to ensure it is well aligned with the HS2 programme. The ICWC operator will play an important role during the construction of HS2 and in facilitating the introduction of High Speed services in 2026. This retiming will allow us to continue to engage with the market on the best options for the franchise to do this. 
We have also made changes in the procurement process to introduce a √Ç¬ìPassport√Ç¬î approach to prequalification of bidders, which will make the franchise bidding process simpler and reduce the barriers to entry for new entrants to the market. This has been designed to streamline the pre-qualification process for rail franchise competitions. In particular, the Passport System is intended to reduce the time and cost involved for Applicants in providing detailed technical information for multiple rail franchise competitions. A Passport is needed for any organisation to express an interest in any future rail franchise competition.
We currently have teams working on 3 live franchise competitions at various stages of completion. West Midlands and South Western are undergoing consultation exercises and developing specifications; East Anglia is currently evaluating bids in preparation for award in the summer. The West Coast team is also in place doing preparatory work to launch the competition later this year. 
A recent PAC report into the programme confirmed the significant progress we have made in improving franchising and the benefits that it has brought to passengers since the launch of the programme in 2013. It highlighted the need to continue to ensure that the franchise market remains competitive. We are taking active steps to do this by working with OGDs and altering our policies to encourage new entrants to the market.

 - The Spending Review 2015 (SR15) settlement announced on 25 November 2015 provides ƒπ¬Å14.8bn of capital funding for the programme over the next five years and sets out an updated funding envelope of ƒπ¬Å55.7bn for delivering HS2 in 2015 prices. This was an excellent outcome for the programme, and provides the funding for construction of Phase 1 to start in 2017 and keeps plans for Phase 2 on track.

 - An updated programme cost and schedule baseline (BL6) has been developed which contains a further level of granularity to inform the assumptions against which the Invitation To Tender for the Main Works Civils Contracts will be assessed. We expect BL6 to be adopted in April 2016.

 - New programme governance arrangements were implemented in December 2015, including a new Programme Board and three new Sponsor Boards (for Phase 1, Phase 2 and Commercial Operations) reporting to it. 

 - There has been significant progress on building capability in the client and delivery organisations as the programme transitions towards the delivery phase, through DfT and HS2 Ltd developing Delivery, procurement and commercial strategies and demonstrating that the right capabilities and skills are in place to move forwards with procurements.  

 - The Integrated Programme Management Office has been set up to put in place effective processes for joint planning, reporting and risk management across the wider programme.

 - The procurement process was also started for seven million trees to be planted alongside the London to West Midlands line to mitigate its impact on woodland. A contract is expected to be awarded in the autumn of 2016, which will provide time for the trees to grow to a sufficient size to be planted out during construction. 
 - On 30 November 2015, the Secretary of State announced his decision to accelerate part of the Phase 2 route (Phase 2a - Birmingham to Crewe), in order to bring benefits to the North earlier, and we commenced work to prepare a hybrid Bill for Parliament to take this forward. Property compensation arrangements for Phase 2a were announced along with the direction of travel on Phase 2b (Crewe to Manchester and Birmingham to Leeds), and the next steps on Crewe and Leeds stations.

","Highways England√Ç¬ís intention is for the A14 to be an exemplar for commercial and procurement best practice in the delivery of major projects. The strategy for delivery has centred on the Collaborative Delivery Framework (CDF) which centres upon the core belief of Highways England that significantly better value can be achieved through its supply chain with greater collaboration and engagement. The Integrated Delivery Team has been formed to enable collaboration between the various partners in the design and construction process along with Highways England. The partners are incentivised to drive down costs and to deliver early. Incentives have been set at a project wide level so that the performance of the A14 scheme, and its completion as a whole, will determine the level of incentive payments.

Successful delivery is forecast with the constant monitoring of programme, budget, spend and management of key risks to delivery. All critical delivery areas have dedicated leaders and are appropriately resourced. A key risk to achieving the start of works commitment is legal challenge to the Development Consent Order outcome.

The Programme was assessed as a Red delivery confidence status during the Programme Assurance Review and subsequently improved to an Amber/Red status at the Gate 2. Following each review the Programme has addressed the recommendations provided via action plans with regular reviews by the Programme Board, which incorporates permanent Major Projects Authority membership. Both reviews noted the considerable progress that had been made by the Programme but also noted further work that was required to increase the delivery confidence of the Programme. The reviews also noted the resource pressures that the Programme had operated under and that the short timeline available for delivery represented a severe challenge.

Several recurring themes of review recommendations have been identified and these have provided a particular focus for the Programme Team. They include Communications and Stakeholder Engagement, Governance and Programme Controls, Procurement Strategy and Solution Design works. All have since received comprehensive review and assurance to ensure that they are fit for purpose.

Following quarter two 2015/16 and the Gate 2b review the Programme has made considerable progress to address the recommendations whilst continuing its progress towards delivery of the Health and Social Care Network. The Programme successfully navigated a tightly planned assurance and approval cycle for the Outline Business Case which resulted in its formal approval in December 2015.

The financial impact had been caused by delays to the migration from NHSmail 1 to NHSmail 2. The review also helpfully identified areas of improvement, for example in informing customers of the transformation.

The overarching aim of the reforms is to get more people saving more for their retirement. The Programme went live in October 2012, delivering:   
1) Automatic enrolment - a new duty on employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme; and to increase the incentive to remain saving in a pension scheme, there is a mandatory employer contribution.
2) The National Employment Savings Trust √Ç¬ñ which has a public service obligation to accept any employer who wishes to use it to meet their employer duty. It provides a good quality pension to individuals on low to moderate earnings. 
3) An employer compliance regime - run by the Pension Regulator to support these measures. 

The implementation approach is gradual, with employers being 'staged' by size, over the period October 2012 to February 2018; and contributions to pension schemes are being gradually increased over time to provide a period of adjustment for employers and individuals, with full contributions being paid from April 2019.
 
Once fully implemented the Department expects to see around 9 million people newly saving or saving more into a workplace pension, and an increase in pension saving of around ƒπ¬Å15 billion a year. ","Programme implementation has been successful, with over 5.8 million people automatically enrolled by over 79,000 employers, high levels of compliance amongst employers and opt-out rates amongst individuals remaining low at around 10%. 

The Programme was positively assessed by The National Audit Office in November 2015, while noting the challenge of supporting the very large volumes of small and micro employers to meet their duties from January 2016 onwards.       

In preparation for this, the Programme delivered a significant piece of work over Autumn 2015 to tailor its communications for smaller employers.

National Rollout of Universal Credit to single unemployed claimants, in 712 Jobcentres and 380 Local Authorities, completed as planned in April 2016.  UC is now available across the whole of Great Britain.

A cohort analysis of the first 8,000 people to claim Universal Credit against a comparator for Jobseekers Allowance (JSA) shows that Universal Credit claimants spend 10 hours more per week looking for work, are 8% more likely to be in work and, on average, work 12 days longer than people on JSA.

Testing of the digitally enabled service for all Universal Credit claimants continues to expand and is now in eight jobcentres  The full service began rolling out nationally from May 2016.

From May 2016, the full service will be delivered in phases initially at 5 jobcentres per month, then scaled up to 50 jobcentres a month in 2017. As each jobcentre rolls out, all new claims will be to Universal Credit, and it will no longer be possible, in that location, to make a new claim to JSA, Employment Support Allowance, Income Support, Housing Benefit or Tax Credits. By the middle of 2018 this transition will be complete and it will no longer be possible to make a claim for legacy benefits or Tax Credits anywhere in Great Britain.

The service has reached a point where any changes (including EU legislative) will be both expensive and technically very difficult to implement.  HMRC are seeking to replace CHIEF with a robust, scaleable and extensible set of import /export services, capable of delivering this critical function into the future.

Progress has been made on developing the programme level End-to-End Delivery Plan, including the integration of components through 2016 and in driving the development of a comprehensive CDS Resource Plan to support delivery.

The performance obligations associated with delivery of this objective are embodied within a Client Specification which forms the basis of the Site Licence Company Agreement (SLCA) and Parent Body Agreement (PBA). Following the application of competitive tension via the competition process and share transfer to a new PBO, a target cost incentivised contract arrangement is in place for delivery of the performance obligations in the contract. A contract period of 14 years is envisaged in two phases each of circa 7 years. The target cost as bid is ƒπ¬Å2.4bn for phase 1 and ƒπ¬Å1.4bn for phase 2. Currently the project is focussed on ""Consolidation"" of the successful bidders commitments into the SLC Lifetime Performance Plan (LTPP).The SLCA anticipates some change to the Target Cost during the Consolidation phase but the full extent of the change will only be known at the end of May 2016. A key enabler to achieving a lower cost for delivering the programme is the NDA's ability to put in place funding to match the programme established by the contractor in the updated LTPP. Should the updated LTPP prove to be unaffordable a further iteration may be required. ","Although the DCA was rated amber in the Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 GMPP returns, there has since been a change in circumstances. The Parent Body (CFP) started work on the Magnox estate on 1st September 2014. There then started a process to ensure that the scope of the contract assumed in the 2012 tender matched the actual status of the decommissioning to be done on each site √Ç¬ñ a process known as Consolidation. It has become clear to the NDA through this Consolidation process that there is a significant difference between the work when the contract was tendered in 2012 and awarded in 2014, and the work that actually needs to be done. The scale of the additional work is such that the NDA Board considers that it could amount to a material change to the specification on which bidders were invited in 2012 to tender. In the light of this the NDA Board has exercised its right to terminate the contract on 2 years√Ç¬í notice. The contract will be terminated in September 2019, after 5 years rather than its full term of 14 years. This termination is made with the agreement of CFP.

Although the deadline for making 95.238% of payments funded by the EU to BPS customers for the 2015 scheme year was extended by the European Commission, this target was actually achieved by the original deadline of 30th June 2016.

The implications of the security requirements and the need for proportionality will become clearer through discussion with DH and advisory bodies such as CPNI. Deployment of the iHub continues however the Programme continues to await a date for when PHE ICT will run a full 'failover' testing which validates the system's ability to move operations to back-up systems during any server failure. The issue is being monitored by the Programme Director.  The change of scope to accomodate 600 extra staff resulted in a redesign requirement causing slippage to the RIBA stage 2 schedule and the procurement schedule. PHE have undertaken an options analysis to mitigate the impact of delays and to maintain procurement momentum. An issue currently being mitigated for is the restruturing of NIS which coincides with the intense design phase of RIBA stage 3 timelines scheduled for the final quarter of this calander year moving thorugh to 2018.

The overarching aim of the reforms is to get more people saving more for their retirement. The Programme went live in October 2012, delivering:   
1) Automatic enrolment - a new duty on employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme; and to increase the incentive to remain saving in a pension scheme, there is a mandatory employer contribution.
2) The National Employment Savings Trust √Ç¬ñ which has a public service obligation to accept any employer who wishes to use it to meet their employer duty. It provides a good quality pension to individuals on low to moderate earnings. 
3) An employer compliance regime - run by the Pension Regulator to support these measures. 

The implementation approach is gradual, with employers being 'staged' by size, over the period October 2012 to February 2018; and contributions to pension schemes are being gradually increased over time to provide a period of adjustment for employers and individuals, with full contributions being paid from April 2019. Once fully implemented the Department expects to see around 10 million people newly saving or saving more into a workplace pension, and an increase in pension saving of around ƒπ¬Å17 billion a year.
","Programme implementation has been successful, with people automatically enrolled,  high levels of compliance amongst employers and opt-out rates amongst individuals remaining low at around 9%.

Actions to improve delivery confidence include: 1. Early communication with the key stakeholders and approvers on the full business case to address questions and issues and ensure a smooth path through the various case approvals.  2.
