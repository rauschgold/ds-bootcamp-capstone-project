2021;DECC_0005_1112-Q1;Geological Disposal Facility Programme (GDF);BEIS;Infrastructure and Construction;The primary objective of the programme is to site and construct a permanent geological disposal facility (GDF) as the safe, secure and environmentally responsible solution to the long-term management of higher-activity radioactive waste in the UK, excluding Scotland.   The programme also supports the delivery of the UK's nuclear new build programme because before development consents for new nuclear power stations are granted, the Government needs to be satisfied that effective arrangements exist or will exist to manage and dispose of the wastes they will produce.;Green;"Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating decreased from Amber to Green. This is primarily due to the following factors: The programme delivery confidence has moved to green in the period due to the progress in engaging volunteer communities; two working groups have been formed and additional interested parties are being actively engaged. The transformation of the Geological Disposal Facility (GDF) programme organisation continues with ongoing recruitment to meet the delivery needs however, there is still work to do on the detailed transformation planning considering the future changes at RWM to enact plans for the NDA's Single Waste Division.  It should be noted that the GDF programme spans a significant time period on a whole life basis and the programme is still at a very early stage in the lifecycle, construction is due to start in the 2040s. The programme still faces exceptional uncertainty levels at this stage, with success dependent on agreeing a site within a willing community and the associated geological uncertainties this presents.";2008-06-30;2040-12-31;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the project's end-date remained scheduled to finish on 31 December  2040  . This is primarily due to the following factors: Significant progress has been made over the past year and work continues to drive the schedule and mitigate risks to meet the delivery milestone dates.  The first two working groups have been established enabling discussions to begin with potential host communities and pioneering research is underway to underpin delivery of the Geological Disposal Facility (GDF) including the testing of a new approach to the sealing of deep boreholes.  The organisational transformation continues to enhance capability as the programme moves from research to delivery leading to enhanced planning for the GDF and additional engagement with regulators building confidence and maintaining a constructive dialogue.  The programme also continues to progress risk mitigation activities and work has been launched to support the bring forward of seismic surveys in support of site evaluation, a key step in the overall GDF site selection process.;£48.47;£33.60;"The budget variance exceeds 5%. The main variances and reduced in year spend are due to two main reasons:
1) There were delays to the initial launch of the siting process resulting in a fewer number of assumed / forecast working groups and the associated costs in this FYr.  This position has started to improve as there are now two working groups in place.   The difficulties associated with CoVID have reduced the planned stakeholder engagement and communication activities with an associated reduction in cost. 
2) There have been delays in the technical work and associated spend; commencement of site evaluation works due to the delays in working group formation and search area agreement.";£12,743.00;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the projects Baseline Whole Life Cost remained at £12743.00m. This is primarily due to the following factors: The costs presented are only currently the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) net costs for the Geological Disposal Facility (GDF) programme - the information on Whole Life Costs (WLC) is derived from figures used in NDA's 2018 Annual Report and Accounts (ARAC) scenario GDF cost estimate (in Sept 2018 money values). Note that the costs reported here only cover NDA costs related to a GDF for legacy waste  and waste arising from the existing fleet of nuclear reactors, it does not include any provision for waste disposal from a new nuclear build programme, as this will be funded by new nuclear operators. In line with other Government programmes at an early stage of development, the WLC estimate does not include any allowance for risk, uncertainty or optimism bias. The estimate is being reviewed alongside the wider update of the programme business case which will be available in due course.

1. Increasing the volume of heat delivered by new or expanded heat network applicant projects through the provision of a proportion of their capital costs in the form of Government loan and grant finance; this will leverage private finance, and other investment funding, into the heat networks. 
2. Delivering carbon savings for carbon budgets 4 and 5 (2023-2032). 
3. Building market capability to develop optimised heat networks that will meet local needs and support heat networks development.";Amber;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating remained at Amber. This is primarily due to the following factors: HNIP Main Scheme is progressing to schedule with all awarded funding drawdown on time.  Key delivery milestones are on track as the project heads into its final year.  To date c.80% of the Main Scheme's available budget for years 1 and 2 has been committed.  The third-party funding initiative platform launched in December 20.;2015-11-25;2022-03-31;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the project's end-date increased from 31 March 2021  to 31 March 2022 . This is primarily due to the following factors: HNIP is being delivered in two phases: the pilot scheme, which is complete, and the Main Scheme which is now in the final year of delivery and scheduled to close to applicants in November 21.;£153.60;£98.57;The budget variance exceeds 5%. The year-end capital spend was 75% of the available in-year budget, and the lower than planned spend was primarily due to three awarded projects withdrawing after the final in-year funding round.;£375.90;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the projects Baseline Whole Life Cost remained at £375.90m. This is primarily due to the following factors: Whole life cost is currently below budget baseline. This is due to the slower than planned Main Scheme mobilisation post launch, and the late withdrawal of three projects awarded funding in year 2 of the Scheme.

The Full Business Case (FBC) is based on the Major Project Baseline developed with Programme & Project Partners (PPP) and a matured view of the project scope and market informed cost and schedule information. Pending FBC approval the project performance continues to be reported against the Outline Business Case (OBC) approved in 2017. Delivery of the project has been affected by Covid-19 since March 2020 with significant efforts ongoing to minimise impact on overall cost and schedule. This report only includes COVID impact up to June 2021, and there is evidence that Lockdown 3 has indeed caused efficiency losses in design completion by limited attendance in the office.

2021;BEIS_0007_2021-Q3;Replacement Analytical Project;BEIS;Infrastructure and Construction;The Replacement Analytical Project is a key component of the Analytical Services Programme, which provides essential services to operations on the Sellafield Site supporting 22 Programmes & approximately 200 Operational Facilities.  The existing facility is 60 years old and cannot provide long-term capability so new analytical facilities need to be established. The Replacement Analytical Project has therefore been initiated to deliver future analytical capability to the Sellafield site, through a major modification of the National Nuclear Laboratory Central Laboratory.  Key modifications are provision of standalone Highly Active (HA), Medium Active (MA) and Special Nuclear Material (SNM) analytical capability.  A key part of the scope is the delivery of 135 Analytical Instruments which will perform the ongoing analysis required by facilities at Sellafield.  Analytical Services remains essential to the delivery of high hazard reduction and remediation until the completion of the Sellafield Ltd mission.;Amber;"The Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating is Amber.This is primarily due to the following factors: The project is made up of a number of workstreams the last of which is due to complete the preliminary design phase in July 21. The delivery of the detailed design will take until Jan 24 and then the Full Business Case will be produced and submitted.
The project has had design slippage in the current phase and is forecasting slippage of the detailed design. This is due mainly to COVID and the late placement of contracts to support the development of the analytical equipment and also partly due to performance issues. Given the early maturity of the project in the preliminary design phase and typically for projects at this stage, the lifetime schedule for future phases is not underpinned and is likely to change as the project matures. Importantly the project has a strategic tolerance to support completion of analytical services in the existing facility by Dec 2030.";2016-09-26;2028-07-10;The project end-date is 10 July 2028. This is primarily due to the following factors: The baseline end date is 10th July 2028.  However,  the Latest forecast of 9th Nov 2028 for completion of project support to active commissioning reflects a 4 month slippage from the Outline Business Case and baseline date, with the significant factors being the impact of COVID and supply chain contract delays.  Given the early maturity of the project in the preliminary design phase and typically for projects at this stage, the lifetime schedule for future phases is not underpinned and is likely to change as the project matures.;£36.19;£28.69;"The budget variance exceeds 5%. The budget of £36.19m represents the planned scope to be delivered against the plan put in place in 2019, which compares to a forecast of actual scope to be delivered at £24.23m, at a cost of £28.69m.  The project has delivered less scope than originally planned due to the multiple impacts of COVID19;  design deliverables delayed due to revised working arrangements and restrictions, limited site access throughout the year causing delays to early construction enabling works and delays placing supply chain contracts with staff being furloughed.  The actual scope delivered has cost more than planned primarily due to the impact of COVID 19 resulting in reduced productivity and inefficient working.";£643.54;The projects Baseline Whole Life Cost is £643.54m. This is primarily due to the following factors: The current baseline of £643.54m reflects the P50 (a probability of 50% to deliver for the cost) cost profile in the Outline Business Case, escalated into 2020/21 money values and incorporating the cumulative positive cost variance up to 2018/19. Given the relative immaturity of the project the P80 (a probability of 80% to deliver for the cost)  is £800M and the upper range is £1Bn from the Outline Business Case in 2019/20 money values (P80 escalated is £878m).

It is a key enabler for  the safe and reliable retrieval and treatment of legacy waste at Sellafield, in support of government and Nuclear Decommissioning Authority strategic objectives.;Amber/red;The Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating is Amber/red.This is primarily due to the following factors: This is a complex nuclear project on an operational nuclear site. The project is undergoing a structured assurance to support the Full Business Case and will come forward for sanction in Q3 2021. It is important that the project identifies the level of technical maturity and supply chain capability and capacity it will carry beyond this gate. Additionally, robust asset management of existing facilities associated with the site effluent infrastructure will need to be demonstrated for the project and wider programme benefits to be realised. The newly established Programme and Project Partnership is being used to deliver this project and its success is critical. Finally, the project has been affected by Covid-19, with significant efforts ongoing to minimise impact on overall cost and schedule. It is also worth noting that this project replaces the current effluent treatment facility and is mission critical to the future safe operation of the site.;2013-05-25;2027-12-20;The project end-date is 20 December 2027. This is primarily due to the following factors: This is a complex nuclear project and its delivery has been affected by Covid-19. The forecast Project lifecycle end date is within the date range sited in the Outline Business Case but has been impcated by Covid-19 and specifically relates to delays in development of a specialist valve prototype. Development of the valve could take longer than anticipated leading to delays in delivery of the SIXEP Continuity Plant capability.  Due to the location of Sellafield getting suppliers from other parts of the country, the ability to get people onto site safely from a worker density viewpoint and the adjacent on-going nuclear operational activities make achieving normal productivity levels impossible. The Sellafield Executive have maximised the position given the circumstances and constraints.;£38.49;£45.54;The budget variance exceeds 5%. The forecast spend for 2020/21 is £45M, 18% higher than the profile in the Outline Business Case.  This is due to the acceleration of construction work in 2019/20 and 2020/21 against the baseline.  While the project is forecasting to be ahead of the baseline at year end this does not reflect the true impact of Covid-19, which has slowed delivery in year and led to some cost inefficiencies.;£589.91;The projects Baseline Whole Life Cost is £589.91m. This is primarily due to the following factors: The bulk of the information in this submission is based around the Outline Business Case approved in 2020. The project is progressing towards Full Business Case approval in Q3 2021 after which the information will be updated.  The approved cost range is £574m to £1,050m (not taking account of Covid-19 impact).  The project forecast is at the upper end of this range.  The Reference Class Forecasting model is likely to exceed the Outline Business Case upper range when Covid-19 impact is included.  A full impact assessment of Covid-19 will be included in the Full Business Case submission.

They will remain an enduring requirement for the UK's economy, security and global ambitions.

Our intent for the Space Based PNT Programme is to improve the resilience of UK Critical National Infrastructure by having the right space-based capability to deliver PNT services in order to protect our way of life and to address the rapidly evolving global threat and hazards landscape.
We will consider the broadest set of options for space -based PNT whilst using the breadth of the Government's experience of major programmes to provide critical analysis of emerging candidate solutions. The programme will be dependent on the identification of clear, cross-Whitehall PNT requirements and collaboration across Government, industry and our wider partners.";Amber;The Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating is Amber.This is primarily due to the following factors: The programme DCA remains Amber, reflecting continued uncertainty in the operating environment (specifically future PNT governance within HMG and the lack of clarity around post-OBC funding for the Space Based PNT Programme (SBPP)). Concern on OBC timeline given shortfalls in resources and the impact of delays to approval of key analytical studies. Recent developments have improved clarity and confidence around the requirements (through endorsement of Cabinet Office PNT Strategy and Key User Requirements), thus enabling the programme to finalise work on developing space-based requirements. The programme's has achieved two of its three Control Points (CP) up to the OBC: CP1 was achieved in December 2020 following completion of Draft Cabinet Office PNT User Requirements along with industry response to the RFI for ideas for space based PNT delivery mechanisms. In March the Sponsor Group approved a CP2 paper, enabling the programme to proceed to CP3, the OBC point in November.;2020-10-01;2030-06-30;"The project end-date is 30 June 2030.

Firstly, the Programme team remains under-strength as is enters an intense 12 months period in which it is necessary to undertake major approval and assurance work for both the first two delivery phases and the Programme's Technical Assistance Facility.  Secondly, funding for the first phase (Wave 1) commencing delivery in early 2022 has recently been increased from £60m to £160m, adding pressure onto short resources and the necessarily fixed final approval deadline.  Finally, the absence of longer term funding certainty beyond Financial Year 21/22 constrains the Fund's ability to signal the degree of confidence needed for the retrofit supply chain to grow sufficiently to meet the cumulative high demand of this and other schemes from 2023 onwards.  All risks are being actively mitigated.;2020-09-09;2030-03-31;"The project end-date is 31 March 2030.

All schools under PF were delivered by April 2018.;Amber;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating remained at Amber. This is primarily due to the following factors: PSBP2 is on track to deliver against programme targets with over 90% of projects in contract. There have been some on site delays due to COVID but these have not resulted in delays to programme handover dates as contractors have been able to make time up. We are now due to deliver 272 of the 277 projects that PSBP2 was committed to deliver. The difference is due to 'nil works' projects: 2 works were undertaken by other DfE Capital building schemes, 2 schools were closed and 1 project was deemed not to be in scope.

In total, 89m of this funding was spent - underspends came from a contract coming in under cost and grants to schools to support mentor costs came in below expected.;£523.70;The projects Baseline Whole Life Cost is £523.70m. This is primarily due to the following factors: The Programme Whole Life Costs are a reflection of the  requirement to establish the delivery of high-quality, subsidised tuition through carefully selected organisations that work with highly-trained tutors within the education system. Primarily working with 5 -16 year olds particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
2021;DFID_0001_1112-Q1;St Helena Airport;FCDO;Infrastructure and Construction;The project aims to establish sustainable air services to St Helena to promote economic development and increased financial self-sufficiency, leading eventually to graduation from UK Government support. This will be done through the construction of an airport and the introduction of scheduled air services. The project will put in place the necessary legal, regulatory and monitoring framework, and includes a series of reforms to be implemented by the St Helena Government to open up the island to inward investment and increased tourism.;Amber/Green;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating remained at Amber/Green. This is primarily due to the following factors: The IPA Delivery Confidence Assessment remains at Amber/Green. The airport is fully operational and working well. Following the principle contractor's financial difficulties and the subsequent termination of the contract, St Helena Airport Limited, an arm's length body of St Helena Government, seamlessly took over responsibility for operations of the airport. This arrangement remains in place. The COVID lockdown in South Africa (since late March 2020) prevents the scheduled air service from operating. Ticket sales had until that point remained strong and passenger numbers were expected to be up from the previous year.  To ensure essential access to the island was maintained charter flights were arranged.  These flights transported medical supplies, vaccines, PPE and medical staff to the island and allowed people to travel to the UK for urgent medical attention that is not available on island.  In addition, medical emergency evacuation flights to South Africa have continued when necessary.;2005-03-15;2026-08-31;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the project's end-date remained scheduled to finish on 31 August  2026  . This is primarily due to the following factors: The scheduled baseline project end date remains 31/08/26, has not changed since last year.  The construction of the airport was completed on schedule with the airport receiving certification during May 2016. St Helena's commercial air service made a strong start since commencing on 14 October 2017. - The department hopes to close the project when firm plans are in place for the completion of outstanding infrastructure works. The following non-project operating environment activities have impacted the project: The COVID 19 pandemic has delayed the Department progressing the workstream that will find the most cost-effective way to bring outstanding capital works to completion. The Department has focused its efforts to ensuring St Helena Government has the resources it needs to respond to COVID 19. We return to this issue as soon as we have resources to do so.;£4.00;£4.00;The budget variance is less than or equal to 5%. The Department commissioned a review of the outstanding infrastructure works and is considering options for the best value for money conclusion to this final part of the project following the principle contractor's financial difficulties and the subsequent termination of the contract.  The project has continued to incur capital costs to complete key aspects of the associated infrastructure including the Bulk Fuel Installation. The project costs remain within the approved budget.  The COVID 19 pandemic has slowed the Department progressing the workstream that will find the most cost-effective way to bring outstanding capital works to completion.  The Department has focused its efforts to ensuring St Helena Government has the resources it needs to respond to COVID 19. We will return to this issue as soon as we have resources to do so.;£445.10;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the projects Baseline Whole Life Cost increased from £285.40m to £445.10m. This is primarily due to the following factors: The whole life costs cover the 40 year design life of the airport. The costs are attributable to both the UK Government and St Helena Government. Areas of expenditure that were included when calculating the whole-life cost are: planning, design, construction, operations, maintenance, asset renewal and/or disposal. Work had been commissioned to review tourism projections based on the real data from flights to date will provide some information on how benefits are likely to be realised. However, with COVID 19 it is not yet known how the pandemic will affect international travel and traveller numbers to St Helena.  The Department will continue to work with St Helena Government to review tourism access - however the focus will be to support efforts to ensuring St Helena Government has the resources it needs to respond to COVID 19. We will return to this issue as soon as we have resources to do so.

This is primarily due to the following factors: ECHO 2 remains on schedule to deliver in September 2023. Since the last annual report, the DCA has moved from Amber/Red to Amber Green. This reflects satisfactory implementation of recommendations made at the May 2020 PAR review and the conclusion of the October 2020 IPA Critical Friend Review to award the Programme a DCA rating of Amber/Green.  It is recognised that, whilst the concern over a legal challenge remains, the programme team, including expert external resource, has well mitigated this risk.;2015-09-01;2023-08-31;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the project's end-date increased from 31 March 2020  to 31 August 2023 . This is primarily due to the following factors: The abandonment of the previous procurement resulted in the closure of the original programme and the reset of the programme to put in place new arrangements for the provision of network services. The date for completion of transition is now 20/09/23.;£40.08;£35.34;The budget variance exceeds 5%. There is an in year reduction in actual costs against baseline for RDEL which represents real savings in year from revisions to resources and the start of a circuit replacement project.  The reduction in CDEL is a combination of reduced costs in year due to delays in starting the project from Covid restrictions, part of the project will push out into 21/22 moving costs from current year.  Currently we have not amended 21/22 and future year forecasts, but included the cost savings into remaining budgets whilst the FBC's are completed for the NSI and DPS contracts.  Forecasts will be updated as these FBC's are approved through HM Treasury and Cabinet Office.;£312.94;The project's Baseline Whole Life Cost is £312.94m.

This is primarily due to the following factors: Although Covid risk continues, the construction site has continued to safely operate at planned capacity. As a result, the timetable for final completion has remained broadly stable. However, the timetable remains subject to further Covid risks and building unknowns, which is why Amber will probably remain the most appropriate confidence assessment for a while yet.;2017-01-01;2022-12-12;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the project's end-date remained scheduled to finish on 12 December  2022  .

It builds on the former Atlas programme in the FCO, but has been substantially reshaped to incorporate former work from DFID and to meet FCDO requirements. Hera is an essential part of a wider FCDO Transformation Programme and will enable the new department's finances and structures to be fully integrated in line with Ministers' objectives. Hera will also help deliver government strategy for providing shared services in the UK and overseas for Partners across Government.;Amber;"Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating decreased from Amber/Red to Amber. This is primarily due to the following factors: The creation of Hera following the merger to form the FCDO has inevitably widened the scope and lengthened the timeline compared to the previous Atlas programme in the FCO. However, the programme has made significant progress. There is a fully approved business case and - despite the challenges of remote working this year - the Hera programme has kept up momentum in configuring and building the new system, and in managing the interdependencies with the wider FCDO Transformation Programme.

As flagged by an IPA gateway review in January 2021 and a follow-up independent review in April, this is a complex and inherently challenging programme, especially at a time of wider organisational restructuring and transformation. The next few months will be a crucial phase of implementation.

This is primarily due to the following factors: Changes to the Programme resulting from the revised scope and timetable following the merger have resulted in a revision of costs from the previous FCO Atlas Outline Business Case to the FCDO Hera Full Business Case. The programme undertook detailed analysis and options appraisal following the merger announcement. The result of that was to extend the implementation timeline to October 2022, with whole-life costs over 10 years of £101.8m (of which the forecast implementation costs are £58.2m).

This is primarily due to the following factors: The 1920-Q2 project end date was a legacy approved date, estimated at Strategic Outline Business Case and updated during submission of the Outline Business Case. This has since been revised further to manage schedule and cost impact of the slippage to Development Consent Order decision. The current Open For Traffic date as approved by DfT's Investment, Portfolio and Delivery Committee (IPDC) 22 March 2021 is 31 December 2028. In addition, the change to public finance in March-20, requires a five-year operating window following 'open for traffic' before formally handing the route over to Operations Directorate making the project end date Dec-33.;£30.00;£30.00;The budget variance is less than or equal to 5%. The delay of Development Consent Order (DCO) decision from April 2020 to 12 November 2020 added a six month delay to start of Preliminary Works as work could not be started until a DCO Decision was received. This start of works has been delayed further due to an ongoing Judicial Review into the Secretary of State's DCO decision. Consequently, the majority of the accrued cost will now present in FY21/22 rather than FY20/21. This change is recorded and approved by DfT's Investment, Portfolio and Delivery Committee 22 March 2021.;£1,977.00;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the projects Baseline Whole Life Cost increased from £1919.90m to £1977.00m. This is primarily due to the following factors: Funding Assurance for the project was delayed from October 2019 to March 2020 to coincide with the Chancellor's Budget Announcement regarding Strategic Transport Infrastructure in general, and the A303 Stonehenge Project in particular. This delay, coupled with an initial delay to Development Consent Order (DCO) decision from 2 April 2020 to 17 July 2020, resulted in significant rework to activity already completed, delay to planned activity and commensurate increase of cost as stated above - this was acknowledged by HMT in October 2020. The impact of further delay of the DCO Decision to 12 November 2020 has resulted in a reprofiling of cost due to inflation, which was approved at DfT's Investment, Portfolio and Delivery Committee 22 March 2021.

This is primarily due to the following factors: Great Western electrification secured additional funding in early 2020 for the purpose of closing out the programme. The baseline is expected to reduce over the coming months, where electrification risks have not materialised and therefore do not require the allocated funding, 

As the programme closes, the baseline will reduce further as projects complete, or continue as individual projects, and any associated project risks do not materialise in the GWRM baseline."

Currently, all trains travelling up the Brighton Main Line to either London Victoria or London Bridge and the Thameslink route through the city must pass through East Croydon station and the flat, partially grade separated junction at the Selhurst triangle north of East Croydon. This constraint imposes inefficient train pathing and operations. Trains waiting in stations are held at red signals across the area, waiting to pass through the junction, leading to high levels of delays and impacting services. CARS is the largest element of the programme and delivers the bulk of overall benefits. However, other schemes including Horsham crossover, Reigate 12-car and Gatwick area track layout also provide benefits within the wider Programme.;Amber/red;"The Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating is Amber/red.This is primarily due to the following factors: The Brighton Mainline Upgrade Programme is at early stages of development.

As the scheme is in the initial stages of Outline Business Case development, there is still considerable uncertainty as to the AFC, which is why it is expressed as a range with a considerable risk allowance. Furthermore, it should be noted that it is likely to be delivered in phases over several control periods.

The OBC has cleared DfT's approval boards, the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury. It has been agreed with DfT and HM Treasury that pre-operational costs will be based on a milestone approach and these will be paid to suppliers as services commence at each base under UKSAR2G. This approach means that more costs will be brought forward into the early part of the contract, but the later years will reduce accordingly and the overall effect is a £115m budget saving.

This is primarily due to the following factors: 

The Senior Responsible Owner has adjusted the delivery confidence to Red overall. Delivery schedule delay of the Army's first vehicles meant that the Approved Initial Operating Capability baseline of July 20 was no longer achievable. This was reset to Jun 21 (Probability 50%) and Sep 21 (Probability 90%).

In March 21 the Senior Responsible Owner commissioned an independent Gateway Review of the programme. This assessed the impact of late discovery technical issues during the demonstration phase of the project and the further work necessary to overcome them. It also identified a number of additional interventions necessary to de-risk the schedule to Full Operating Capability.

The principle reasons for the delay experienced included a degree of optimism bias in the schedule for a new generation of armoured fighting vehicle, the technical challenges faced and evidence to support safety case generation, COVID-19 and delivery performance. A detailed action plan has been initiated to rectify the issues identified and all Full Operating Capability assumptions are being re-tested as part of this ongoing activity.

Concurrently, all Initial Operating Capability vehicles have now been manufactured.

The Whole Life Budgets in relation to AJAX are associated with the completion of Demonstration and Manufacture activities within the programme, resulting in the delivery of 589 AJAX vehicles. The Budgets also include In Service Support until 2025, which is primarily delivered through the contracted General Dynamics UK support solution. This element delivers a support framework and purchase of spares to support in service vehicles.

Although the Baseline Forecast Budget from Q2 19/20 £6288.953m to Q4 20/21 £6353.940m appears to increase by £64.987 this is because historic budgets are not adjusted as Programme costs and budgets are rolled forward into future years. The Whole Life Budget c.£6.4Bn currently covers the period up to the end of Manufacture as per the Main Gate approval.  The Whole Life Costs from Q2 19/20 £6143.994m to Q4 20/21 £6005.698m have actually reduced by £138.296m.

Whole Life Cost reductions were driven by removal of the Fire, Support and Overwatch requirement from the Demonstration work within the AJAX programme. Also efficiencies were realised in the In Service Support costings where modelling identified further coverage from current contract arrangement (across spares and Contractor Logistic Support) this then enabled a costing reduction."

The availability of specialist programme resources, and the need to iterate requirements has resulted in the MODNET Evolve contracting period taking longer to deliver than originally planned.  These issues have now been resolved and plans are in place to transition to the new services.  However, there remains a risk that all services may not be delivered by March 22 and action may need to be taken to sustain the current services.

The scheme will help stimulate economic growth and regeneration within the city as well as responding to help address the current Climate Emergency.;Amber;The Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating is Amber.This is primarily due to the following factors: This is the first annual return for LFAS2 . The project is rated as amber on the basis the project is progressing well - tasks outlined last quarter such as finalising a land purchase and the submission of Step 2 planning documents have both been achieved. Design and construction works are approximately 30% of the way through the programme and stakeholders continue to be engaged via dedicated recourses in the project team. Therefore over the course of the year risks on the project have decreased and the project end date remains unchanged.;2016-09-01;2024-10-18;The project end-date is 18 October 2024. This is primarily due to the following factors: The project is progressing well with 30% of design and construction complete. The project end date remains unchanged;£24.83;£14.00;"The budget variance exceeds 5%. The cashflow shows expenditure slipping into future years, albeit that the forecast outturn position for the project remains unchanged. 
The reasons for cost slippage is the focus on up-front design activities and discharging planning conditions. In addition, the effects of the coronavirus pandemic have also contributed to the expenditure slippage.  
It should be noted that the overall programme remains unchanged as we have used float and time risk allowances on these activities.";£146.37;The projects Baseline Whole Life Cost is £146.37m. This is primarily due to the following factors: There is no change to the baseline WLC. Delivery costs are based on well-established spend to dare and tendered costs. Future operation and maintenance costs are based upon standard estimates of assets being constructed and flood risk.

Our scheme will provide a long term solution to flooding in Oxford, helping protect the city as flood risk increases with climate change.

The scheme will run through the existing floodplain west of Oxford. It will be formed of a new stream surrounded by a gently sloping floodplain of new wetland habitat and grazing meadow to create more space for water away from built-up areas.";Amber;The Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating is Amber.This is primarily due to the following factors: We have confidence in the delivery of Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme with respect to the design, quality and ability to meet our current programme. The scheme is fully funded and we have confidence that this will remain to be the case for our Full Business Case. We are carefully managing and monitoring the risk that our programme could move due to external factors.  We are working closely with Oxfordshire County Council to mitigate this risk.;2014-04-02;2030-01-09;The project end-date is 09 January 2030. This is primarily due to the following factors: Project delivery is within cost and programme forecasts.;£2.94;£2.24;The budget variance exceeds 5%. In the last financial year the scheme has undergone significant change brought about by external challenges that have led to re-design of certain elements of the scheme and withdrawal of our Compulsory Purchase Order and planning application. This has resulted in a longer programme, pushing out planning approval and construction completion. This has changed our expenditure needs, reducing contractor costs significantly, as well as consultants and our internal staff.;£204.83;"The projects Baseline Whole Life Cost is £204.83m. This is primarily due to the following factors: The whole life cost for the Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme, considers all the work needed before, during and after scheme construction. This includes the cost of the work needed to design the scheme; gain the necessary planning approvals; purchase the required land and obtain business case approvals. It also considers the cost of materials and labour to construct the scheme, allowing for inflation and contingency for any risks which could occur and impact the delivery programme or cost. It also further includes the estimated cost of works needed to maintain the scheme over a 100 year period to ensure that it can operate at full capacity as a flood alleviation scheme and ensure benefit delivery."

a) The Covid-19 pandemic which affected the delivery of business as usual activities (e.g., the pausing of all our face-to-face services and operating at a significantly reduced level for the first half of the 2020/21 financial year. This led to lower cost than expected being spent as several teams virtualised their services during this period and,
b) Efficiencies gained via less spending on operational activities.";£18.58;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the projects Baseline Whole Life Cost increased from £11.70m to £18.58m. This is primarily due to the following factors: Compared to Q2 2019/20 the programme's Baseline Whole Life Cost increased from £11.70m to £18.58m. This is primarily due to additional funding received in the 2020/2021 financial year from the Cabinet Office's Accelerator Fund and a one-year, one-off £3m central funding from CO/HMT to improve the capability of contract management across government. This fund was used to cover the costs of delivering contract management courses including funding for attendees from government departments to attend the Practitioner and Expert level courses.

Key achievements - now supported by a transformation portfolio - are:
- Security leadership has been enhanced through the creation of the roles of the Government Chief Security Officer and Chief Security Officers in lead departments;
- Departmental security capability has been strengthened by the recruitment of Security Advisers and a cadre of SCS Security Advisers (10 of whom are women making up over 50% of Senior Security Advisers);
- A strong professions agenda has been established, providing a clear career framework for our people and enabling us to drive up capability in key areas;

The provisional settlement under the current one-year Spending Review has seen the programme secure the required non-pay funding for 2021/22, and 45 of the 48 requested posts have been funded. However, it will take the programme time to get approval for and recruit resource permitted by the funded template and sufficient to plan and manage business-change effectively. Furthermore, the uncertainty over funding for subsequent years adds uncertainty over the life of the programme (2024) which will need to be managed as best possible in the very short term. If we do not secure funding we will need to look again at the scope of the programme.

It provides practical and technical support and funding to councils, central government and other public sector partners working together to deliver ambitious property-focused programmes.;Amber/Green;The Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating is Amber/Green.This is primarily due to the following factors: OPE continues to deliver strong outputs as the programme reaches maturity, recently completing the funding process for an additional £10m for Phase 8 and the FBC being approved by HMT for Phase 9. Delivery is at a slower pace than forecast in the phase 1-7 business cases for a variety of reasons, predominantly overly optimistic early forecasts of benefits, the complexity of delivering multi partner projects across the public sector, and an inherent risk in large capital schemes. The programme has been adversely impacted by COVID, and there is a risk that some of the early forecast outputs will either not be delivered or will fall outside of the current programme timescales. However the programme team has a mature risk management processes and governance that provides confidence this is being managed. Ambitions have been realigned to match these new forecasts.;2013-04-01;2023-03-31;The project end-date is 31 March 2023. This is primarily due to the following factors: The OPE programme provides funding for early stage project works and, as such, project timeframes can range significantly. Project benefits are currently captured within a 10 year timeframe, with the most recent projects having been funded in 2021.;£10.00;£10.00;The budget variance is less than or equal to 5%. ;£93.00;The projects Baseline Whole Life Cost is £93.00m. This is primarily due to the following factors: OPE whole life costs are included to 20/21. This does not include projected staffing costs beyond 20/21 as these are subject to approval.
2021;CO_0028_2021-Q4;Vetting Transformation Programme;CO;Government Transformation and Service Delivery;"The Vetting Transformation Programme is building a workforce with the right set of skills, fully exploiting technology opportunities and implementing a new vetting standard, the programme has the following aims;Faster clearances, processing times will be reduced by implementing a single joined up end to end process that eliminates duplication; enabling individuals to be recruited into vetting roles quicker.Provide a far better user experience, facilitated by frictionless HR and Security data sharing and record management. Clearances will be portable, individuals will be able to move seamlessly between departments.On-going assurance of our people through a cross-functional approach to managing employee risk throughout the employee lifecycle, to better assure the integrity of individuals with privileged access.Aligning to these outcomes will provide government departments with a trusted vetting service that adheres to its customer's needs and will strengthen our international reputation.The wider aspiration is to create a trusted capability that positions itself as the provider of choice for vetting services that enables expansion of its customer base beyond its current consumers.";Amber;The Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating is Amber.This is primarily due to the following factors: Early last year it was agreed across departments that the first year costs for Vetting Transformation should be met via burden share. This amount was calculated and agreed at £3m, having been reduced due to a delayed start from £4m. The programme has optimised and spent the £3m investment this year appropriately and effectively, mobilising in October 20 and so far delivering to plan. The programme has secured a further £5.1m of partner funding for 2021/22. As of April 21 the programme will move from DPC to UKSV and the SRO will change. The new SRO will review priorities and an OBC will be submitted to HMT early in the new FY.;2019-03-01;2023-03-31;The project end-date is 31 March 2023. This is primarily due to the following factors: The Vetting Transformation Programme forecast end-date is 31 March 2023.  This has not been rebaselined since it was established in the Programme's approved SOC.;£3.00;£3.01;The budget variance is less than or equal to 5%. ;£8.10;The projects Baseline Whole Life Cost is £ 8.10m. This is primarily due to the following factors: The Whole Life Cost of the Vetting Transformation Programme has not been rebaselined since it was established in the programme's approved SOC. The programme has spent to forecast in FY20/21.
2021;CO_0029_2021-Q4;Workplace Services Transformation Programme;CO;Government Transformation and Service Delivery;The Workplace Services Transformation Programme (WSTP) has been established to realise the ambition of a transformed workplace experience for all GPA customers (end users) and to ensure better value for our clients (Departments).;Amber/red;The Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating is Amber/red.This is primarily due to the following factors: The WST Programme funding has been secured through the SR20 bid 21/22 (and will be subject to a SR21 bid for ongoing funding). The WSTP Supply Chain Project (SCP), Outline Business Case (OBC) seeking authority to go to market for new FM Contracts was endorsed by the GPA Investment Committee and approval has been requested from the GPA Board on 8th April 2021.;2020-05-01;2023-09-01;The project end-date is 01 September 2023.

2021;DCMS_0009_1516-Q4;700 MHz Clearance Programme;DCMS;Infrastructure and Construction;The objective of the programme is to clear the 700 MHz radio spectrum so that it can be used for new, more advanced mobile broadband services. The programme consists of the following projects: 1) Infrastructure programme to clear the spectrum - comprising implementing a new transmission frequency plan for Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) broadcasting, building or modifying broadcast masts and antennas, including over 80 main transmitters, and administering the payment of grants to deliver this infrastructure work. 2) Programme Making Special Events (PMSE) -  putting in place alternative spectrum for the PMSE community and delivering a Help Scheme for current PMSE users impacted by the Programme. 3) Viewer Support - communicating to DTT viewers if they need to retune their TV equipment, and providing support to affected viewers that may need to repoint or replace their aerials.;Green;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating decreased from Amber/Green to Green. This is primarily due to the following factors: The 700 MHz Spectrum is cleared and viewer support has finished.;2015-01-13;2022-01-01;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the project's end-date remained scheduled to finish on 01 January  2022  . This is primarily due to the following factors: No deviation - the 700 MHz Spectrum is cleared and viewer support has finished.;£69.90;£32.20;"The budget variance exceeds 5%. There have been savings across all of the main delivery areas of the project (Infrastructure; Performance Equipment; and Viewer Support). Further savings have been realised from costs budgeted for co-existence which are now planned to be included in the terms of the spectrum sale. Additional costs forecast to cover for potential delays caused by the impact of COVID have now been stripped out.";£595.00;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the projects Baseline Whole Life Cost remained at £595.00m. This is primarily due to the following factors: No change in whole life costs, the 700 MHz Spectrum is cleared, viewer support has finished.
2021;DCMS_0008_1516-Q4;Blythe House Programme;DCMS;Infrastructure and Construction;The objectives of the Blythe House Programme are to ensure that: 1) Blythe House is put to its most efficient and effective use in order to deliver maximum value for money  2) The Blythe House museums are able to care for their collections in the most efficient and effective way;Amber;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating increased from Amber/Green to Amber. This is primarily due to the following factors: The DCA has increased from Amber/Green to Amber since the last ARMP as a direct result of the  COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted on both the delivery schedule and programme cost. Schedules were affected by site closures, and on re-opening, the need to operate in a COVID-secure manner, which reduced productivity in terms of construction and in preparing the national museum collections for their move from Blythe House. Additional costs were also incurred as a result of the pandemic. DCMS is working with the museums to assess the impact on schedule but remains confident that the programme aims of protecting the museum collections and maximising the sale of Blythe House can be met.;2015-04-01;2023-03-31;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the project's end-date remained scheduled to finish on 31 March  2023  . This is primarily due to the following factors: The three museum construction projects and the decant from Blythe House were affected by limited site closures and reduced productivity because of the need to operate in a COVID-secure manner, however, work continued on all sites throughout the second lockdown period. The Science Museum Group's Building ONE is now nearing completion and will start to receive objects being moved from Blythe House from June 2021. Each project has undertaken re-programming of activities, and DCMS is working with the museums to assess the eventual impact of the pandemic on baselined milestones towards the disposal of Blythe House.;£50.06;£58.90;The budget variance exceeds 5%. The variance does not represent a change in overall programme spend, but reflects the management of grant in aid drawdown from year to year. The in-year forecast spend represents anticipated expenditure on the Blythe House project, while the baseline represents what is being drawn down in grant in aid funding. There is an arrangement whereby the museums can draw down the grant in aid funding for non-Blythe House project expenditure, and 'repay' it to the project in future years.;£215.19;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the projects Baseline Whole Life Cost increased from £210.24m to £215.19m. This is primarily due to the following factors: The increase in the programme's Whole Life Cost derives from an approved  increase in the Victoria & Albert Museum's project cost, which will be funded by Non-Government sources.
2021;DCMS_0011_1718-Q3;5G Testbeds & Trials;DCMS;Infrastructure and Construction;The 5G Testbeds and Trials Programme is the Government's nationally coordinated programme of investment in 5G. The Programme looks to harness areas where the UK has a competitive advantage - such as in scientific research, engineering talent and our rich variety of technology businesses. The Programme is exploring the benefits and challenges of deploying 5G technologies.;Amber/Green;"Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating decreased from Amber to Amber/Green. This is primarily due to the following factors: All 5GTT projects are now up and running, with all competitions concluded; currently 18 of the live projects reporting an A/G RAG status.- The Programme remains on track to deliver by March 2022, although risks around key roles/activities required to close the Programme in a control manner have been outlined and mitigations are being pursued, as identified in the latest IPA Gateway 0 Review. 
The IPA Gateway 0(B) Review of February 2021 awarded a DCA rating of Amber, giving positive feedback on progress to date and recommendations for continuing positive progress made within DCMS/across government. The Programme has completed recommendations made in the July 2019 report. Recommendations from the February 2021 report have been gathered and assigned action owners, with positive progress being made to address. ";2017-02-28;2022-03-31;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the project's end-date increased from 31 March 2021  to 31 March 2022 . This is primarily due to the following factors: The Programme was granted an extension, and is scheduled to close 31 March 2022. The Programme currently remains on track to deliver and complete all projects by this date. However, it has been identified that the Programme would benefit from an extension of a further year to allow for a longer window for benefits to be realised. The team has also outlined key roles required to carry out post-project closure activities to ensure the Programme closes in a successful, controlled manner in the six month period following Programme closure if an extension were not permitted.;£44.40;£40.30;"The budget variance exceeds 5%. Resource expenditure for 2020/21 was £5.8m against £5.9m budget (99% utilisation). 
Capital Expenditure on 5G was  £33.9m against £38.5m budget. HMT requested 5G budget should also cover expenditure on Cell Broadcasting, which was £11.9 for 20/21. Cell Broadcasting expenditure was covered by a mix of 5G underspend and underspend secured elsewhere within DCMS.";£232.75;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the projects Baseline Whole Life Cost remained at £232.75m. This is primarily due to the following factors: To date, the programme has spent combined RES-del and CAP-del £107m.
2021;DCMS_0010_1718-Q3;Local Full Fibre Networks;DCMS;Infrastructure and Construction;"The Local Full Fibre Networks Programme (LFFN) is a pilot to stimulate greater commercial investment to deliver faster and more reliable connectivity by providing fibre broadband to public sector buildings; finding new and innovative ways to re-purpose existing network infrastructure and offering an SME-focused grant through a supplier-led voucher. Greater availability of these networks will enable businesses and individuals to access the gigabit-capable connectivity that they need both now and for the future, as well as facilitating the deployment of 5G. Benefits include stimulation of the broadband market, and better infrastructure and improvements in the overall network.  There are also wider economic benefits including business productivity and growth in jobs.";Amber;"Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating decreased from Red to Amber. This is primarily due to the following factors: Since HMT approval was granted to extend beyond March 2021, LFFN has been rated 'Amber', from 'Red'. It continues to be 'Amber' because 10 out of 40 projects were delivered by the end of March 2021. 
. All Wave 1 projects have delivered the BDUK funded elements of their projects.
. 16 out of 17 Wave 2 projects have passed Checkpoint C. 
. 20 out of 20 Wave 3 projects have passed Checkpoint C.";2017-04-01;2021-12-31;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the project's end-date increased from 01 December 2021  to 31 December 2021 . This is primarily due to the following factors: HMT approval has been given to extend the programme to December 2021. All projects are planned to be completed within this schedule.;£106.70;£99.92;"The budget variance exceeds 5%. The forecasts for 2020-21 and 2021-2 are based on the current delivery profile; likely to be affected by COVID-19. The slippage allowance  is 75% of Q4 claims that have been rated a high risk of not being claimed for slipping into 2021-22.";£302.30;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the projects Baseline Whole Life Cost decreased from 321.10m to £302.30m. This is primarily due to the following factors: Since the last quarter the capital forecast has been reduced as a result of projects needing to descope sites.  The voucher forecast has been reduced as cancellations have increased.
2021;DCMS_0012_1819-Q2;Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games;DCMS;Infrastructure and Construction;The 2022 Commonwealth Games will be held in Birmingham, from 28 July to 8 August. Birmingham 2022 will showcase Birmingham, the West Midlands and the entire country to the rest of the world as a destination for international trade, education, and world class sport and tourism. The Games will deliver a fully integrated and inclusive para-sport programme. The Government is providing a substantial part of the overall funding and will want to ensure successful delivery, on time and within budget. The Games will be delivered in 2022 amongst a year of notable major events for the UK - including the Queen's Platinum Jubilee.;Amber;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating decreased from Amber/Red to Amber. This is primarily due to the following factors: Delivery of the 2022 Commonwealth Games has continued on track, despite a significantly challenging programme and project delivery landscape - with considerable uncertainty and turbulence generated via the Covid--19 pandemic. An IPA Project Assessment Review conducted in Q4 2019-20 concluded positively that Games planning is 'on schedule' with programme finances in a 'strong position' and subsequently the Delivery Confidence Assessment for the programme increased from an Amber/Red to an Amber rating. Looking ahead into 2021-2022, the programme will continue to navigate notable challenges within the Covid-19 recovery landscape, adjusting planning and building in suitable flexibilities into operational planning as the recovery landscape develops and as further policy implications begin to manifest for delivery of major sports events and the return of physical spectator audiences ahead of Summer 2022. DCMS continues to look forward to delivering the event safely and successfully as a key part of a series of celebratory events in 2022, including the Queen's Platinum Jubilee.;2017-12-21;2023-03-31;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the project's end-date remained scheduled to finish on 31 March  2023  . This is primarily due to the following factors: Delivery of the 2022 Commonwealth Games has continued on track, despite a significantly challenging landscape both domestically and internationally with the Covid-19 pandemic. Significant delivery milestones for the Commonwealth Games have been achieved throughout the last financial year, including the publication of a Commonwealth Games Legacy and Benefits plan, launch of the Games Mascot and Royal Assent was given for the Birmingham Commonwealth Games Act. Significant progress has also continued to be seen on the critical capital project and infrastructure sites for the Games, with the implementation of enhanced Covid-19 health and safety provisions on these sites to protect workers and to support delivery continuity throughout the pandemic. The Games are still on track to be delivered in the Summer of 2022, DCMS continues to look forward to delivering the event safely and successfully as a key part of a series of celebratory events in 2022, including the Queen's Platinum Jubilee.;£111.81;£87.16;The budget variance exceeds 5%. The original baseline budget of £111.81m reduced in year to a revised budget of £84.7m due to changes to the expected profile of spend. In particular this related to the capital projects, which revised their milestone projects to deliver more in 2021/22 than originally envisaged, resulting in a budget reduction for 2020/21 to £84.7m.  The latest forecast of £81m (based on Feb 21 information) will result in a £3.7m underspend which equates to a 4.4% underspend against the revised budget, which is below the 5% variance required. Please note the £87.16m forecast above excludes income.;£886.90;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the projects Baseline Whole Life Cost increased from £886.89m to £886.90m. This is primarily due to the following factors: Spend across the programme remains on track, within budget and forecasts.
2021;DCMS_0013_1819-Q3;4th National Lottery Licence Competition;DCMS;Government Transformation and Service Delivery;The 4th National Lottery Licence Competition Programme is responsible for ensuring the continuation of the National Lottery on the expiry of the current 3rd Licence in July 2023.  This involves designing a new licence fit for the future and selecting an operator via a competitive application process who is able to continue to develop the National Lottery as a public asset in order to maximise the returns to good causes whilst also ensuring the highest standards of propriety and player protection.;Amber;"Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating remained at Amber. This is primarily due to the following factors: The overall programme lifecycle delivery confidence was rated as AMBER by the Infrastructure and Projects Authority at the Gate 2 review undertaken at the end of July 2020, given the longer-term impact of COVID-19 on applicants and the overall risk profile of the Programme.

The programme is confident that it will be in a position to improve the current IPA Amber rating within quarter 1 (21/22). The improvement will be demonstrated by agreeing the final timing for approval of the Full Business Case and the expected continuation of a high number and strength of applicants remaining active within the competition.";2018-11-16;2024-02-01;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the project's end-date increased from 01 August 2023  to 01 February 2024 . This is primarily due to the following factors: The programme end date has moved from 1 Aug 23 to 1 Feb 24 in response to delays caused by Covid19.  Potential applicants raised concerns about assembling application teams and preparing their applications during the lockdown restrictions so to ensure applicants didn't withdraw from the competition and to maintain a strong competitive field of applicants a six month extension to the programme was agreed.  In order to delay the start of the 4th Licence by 6 months, it has been necessary to extend the existing 3rd Lottery licence by six months so there is no interruption to the National Lottery.;£16.35;£15.03;The budget variance exceeds 5%. The yearly costs are lower than expected because of the deferment of competition evaluation costs to the following year as well as cost savings made on professional services to support the programme as more activity was able to be undertaken in house.  The competition evaluation costs were deferred because the initial engagement from applicants to the Invitation to Apply for the 4th Licence was much higher than expected resulting in additional time being required for them to submit their phase 1 applications which in turn pushed the evaluation period and costs into the following financial year.   Although this has caused a slight delay, the level of engagement from applicants indicates a strong competition which should generate highly competitive applications.;£91.92;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the projects Baseline Whole Life Cost increased from £64.34m to £91.92m. This is primarily due to the following factors: The increase in whole life costs is due to two main factors.  Firstly, a more thorough and robust competition with far greater engagement with the market and potential applicants which has resulted in a strong and highly competitive competition.  Secondly, the costs have also increased because of the six month extension to the programme in response to the delays caused by Covid19.
2021;DCMS_0014_1920-Q2;Rural Gigabit Connectivity Programme;DCMS;Infrastructure and Construction;"The Rural Gigabit Connectivity Programme (RGC) is testing innovative approaches to deploying full fibre in the most difficult to reach areas (initially identified as the ""final 10%"" of UK premises but subsequently extended to 20%) where the market alone is unlikely to deliver. The programme will establish new full-fibre 'hubs' to rural public buildings and offer vouchers from the Gigabit Broadband Voucher Scheme to stimulate demand from community groups and attract investment in eligible rural areas.";Amber/Green;"Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating decreased from Red to Amber/Green. This is primarily due to the following factors: The programme has delivered its overarching learning objective which has informed the UK Gigabit programme, as well as generating contracted hubs and issued vouchers. This has been at a slower rate than projected, but has now provided the UK Gigabit programme with a significant pipeline for delivery within the Final 20%.
The target for sites delivered by end 20/21 was revised down to 457 early in Q3 20/21, to reflect delivery progress in the contracts. The latest out-turn forecast for 20/21 is 266-302. The remaining contracted sites are forecast to be completed in 21/22.
The hub site projects initiated in Q4 20/21 should be successfully contracted in Q1-Q2 21/22 and will form the first year of hub delivery under the UK Gigabit Programme.";2019-05-01;2021-05-01;"Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the project's end-date remained scheduled to finish on 01 May  2021  . This is primarily due to the following factors: In Q4 20/21 three projects completed BDUK Assurance to a point where they were ready to contract and deliver in 21/22:  Highlands and NHS Scotland (Phase 2's), and North of Tyne.
Also in Q4 20/21, two further projects completed BDUK Assurance to a point where they are now ready to procure, they will then be ready to contract in early 21/22.";£38.50;£29.80;The budget variance exceeds 5%. RGC uses two methods to increase fibre infrastructure and takeup: connecting public buildings to act as hubs and rural connection vouchers. The capital reduction is mainly due to reduced vouchers connections spend forecast where the impact of the change in accounting recognition point was difficult to forecast.;£75.90;Compared to financial year 19/20-Q2, the projects Baseline Whole Life Cost decreased from 212.80m to £75.90m. This is primarily due to the following factors: The Budgeted Whole Life Costs reduction is largely due to a change in the cost recognition point for vouchers and more time taken to identify the right projects and estates for hubs, which slightly changed the profile of the pipeline.  This was exacerbated by the effect of COVID and the prioritisation by suppliers on maintenance rather than new infrastructure. The change in the cost recognition point for vouchers was necessary due to a change in treatment advice received from the NAO with the result that voucher connections delivered in 2021/22 will form part of the UK Gigabit Programme and can be accommodated within that programme's budget given that the premises concerned are in the UK final 20%.

This will enable the Museum to secure and digitise its growing collections for increased research use throughout this century and into the next, providing a springboard for partnerships, and employing and developing new technologies.";Amber;The Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating is Amber.This is primarily due to the following factors: Our Amber Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating is primarily due to the programme being under IPA monitoring. As recommended by the IPA we are making programme budgeting a key focus of our first formal review and have scheduled it in early summer to enable recommendations to be acted on ahead of the outline business case submission. The NHM@Harwell Programme team are also drawing up a shortlist of projects and programmes we would like to benchmark against to improve cost certainty as recommended by IPA. Further to this we have explored our key programme risks, including some related to budget, with DCMS experts and the Natural History Museum's Infrastructure Committee and are planning a formal 'deep dive' review of programme risks with IPA and DCMS. NHM@Harwell are also in ongoing discussions with the DCMS to develop a Memorandum of Understanding with HM Treasury on end year flexibility to ensure effective joint work to manage the programme budget.;2019-05-15;2026-12-30;"The project end-date is 30 December 2026. This is primarily due to the following factors: The programme is still working to the schedule agreed in the Strategic Outline Case+, with the decision on what collections move to Harwell expected this summer, Royal Institute of British Architects stage 3 of the build programme planned to begin in autumn, and construction commencing in 2023. 
The scope to bring forward the start date of construction has recently been explored and, following modelling of the knock on consequences for budget and timeline, a decision to retain the current timeline has been taken.

As a result some anticipated benefit realisation in 2021/22 is likely to be slowed and move into 2022/23 but the programme are not predicting an impact on the long-term benefits.;2019-10-01;2024-04-01;The project end-date is 01 April 2024. This is primarily due to the following factors: The programme is on track to be completed by the end of 2023/24. The timeline allows for the incremental delivery of data sets and targeting modes along with the underlying capabilities. This incremental approach to delivery allows for a steady and manageable change process which boosts feedback at each stage. This feedback can be thoroughly explored, and the agile working of the project means that changes required can be added into delivery plans. In addition, the timeline and sequencing of activities has been arranged to allow for the changes in technology and ways of working to land effectively and for the resulting capabilities to be fully leveraged.;£28.50;£28.50;The budget variance is less than or equal to 5%. ;£172.10;"The projects Baseline Whole Life Cost is £172.10m. This is primarily due to the following factors: Baseline WLC: Key factors that led to Cerberus project to set its Q4 2020/21 Baseline Whole life Cost are:

External HMRC data source funding
External industry data source funding
Fixing data quality issues with providers
Big Match and Entity Search may be insufficient to meet the requirements of the project requiring an additional technology

These services are currently outsourced under the Front-End Services UK and Next Generation of Outsourced Visas contracts and the project will look to procure equivalent services to maintain visa services; while maximising value and efficiency, which is a critical enabler for building and sustaining the UK's growth and prosperity.";Amber/red;The Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating is Amber/red.This is primarily due to the following factors: The Amber/Red rating reflects the lack of any contingency in the plan to award new contracts.  Work is underway to produce the requirement schedules for the commercial tender, however time for mobilisation and transition is also tight, this will be tested during the tender process. In addition, there is a lack of certainty on key dependency commitments from the Future Borders and Immigration (FBIS) Programme who are currently working through their detailed planning for 2021/22 and beyond.;2019-12-12;2024-05-01;The project end-date is 01 May 2024. This is primarily due to the following factors: FSS proposes to procure broadly equivalent services with flexibility to implement transformational changes envisaged as part of the Future Borders and Immigration System (FBIS) programme. A more digitally focused vision for visa applications is expected in the timeframe, enabled by remote biometric capture, which will fundamentally change the nature of front-end services. The front-end services contracts within the scope of this business case are therefore transitional in nature but designed to support the establishment of this digital vision.;£1.20;£1.20;The budget variance is less than or equal to 5%. ;£927.50;The projects Baseline Whole Life Cost is £927.50m. This is primarily due to the following factors: The prorgamme anticipate a whole life spend of £927.50m for the new contracts.  There is no option available to extend the current contracts at the same cost, and all three available options under consideration are more expensive than the current contract and funding.  The preferred option we anticipate will be approved and is the cheapest of the three options considered.

This is primarily due to the following factors: The Programme delivered all of it's Business Case objectives for FY20/21.  The operating model to scale up delivery is in place.  This includes scaling up capability and capacity of the internal delivery team, aswell as concluding procurement to appoint new data and digitisation suppliers.  The Engagement Strategy is proving successful with local authorities signing up for migration to the new service, enabling us to deliver the ambitious 4 year data migration timeframe.    The Welsh Government has approved legislation to be part of the new service.
