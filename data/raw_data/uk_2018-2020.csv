 - Our programme reported Amber RAG status for the majority of 2018/19 - however, it went back down to Amber/Red  in Q1 2019/20.  This was mainly due to the stakeholder engagement challenges presented by Brexit - both within central government departments and Wider Government Bodies.  Departments had limited ability to engage in capability building intervention due to having other Brexit pressing priorities

29,A12 Chelmsford to A120 Widening,DfT,Amber,A12 Chelmsford to A120 Widening - widening the A12 to three lanes between junction 19 (north of Chelmsford) and junction 25 (A120 interchange). ,"The IPA Delivery Confidence Assessment (DCA) rating at Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) was Amber, due primarily to the following factors;

 - In September 2019, the project was preparing to announce a preferred route announcement for Junctions 19 to 23, as well as a non-statutory consultation for Junctions 23 to 25. The delivery confidence assessment was based on three key outstanding issues which were causing increased project uncertainty on how the scheme would progress.  

Firstly, there was uncertainty on the timing and outcome of the North Essex Authorities Local Plan, which included the Colchester Braintree Borders Garden Community. Whether the Garden Community was found viable or not in the Local Plan would inform the decision on a proposed route between Junction 23 and 25, as the route may have needed to divert southwards around the proposed Garden Community footprint.
 - Secondly,  in order to divert the road southwards to accommodate the Garden Community, the project required additional funding. The additional funding was to come forward via a Housing Infrastructure Bid submitted by Essex County Council to MHCLG. At the time of the DCA, it was not known whether this would be approved. 
 - Finally, there was a risk of delay to making the PRA for Junction 19-23, a critical milestone to maintain the delivery programme. Approval was subject to discussions with DfT around the interaction with potential RIS3 pipeline projects such as the A120 Braintree to A12. Failure to make the PRA for Junction 19 to 23 in October 2019 would have introduced a significant delay and additional costs.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Amber IPA DCA, the following non-project operating environment activities have impacted the original Q2 IPA DCA;

 - The sources of uncertainty highlighted in the September 19/20 DCA assessment have been resolved.
In May 2020, the Planning Inspector's report on the Local Plan determined that the Colchester Braintree Borders Garden Community was unviable.  This is not expected to be challenged by the Local Authorities.  While Housing and Infrastructure Funding was announced in March 2020, this was conditional on delivering the Garden Community housing.  This funding is now expected to be withdrawn.  
 - With no viable Garden Community, and without funding for the additional costs of realignment of the A12 further south, the project now has clarity on the recommended route alignment.  This recommendation will be taken through governance with the intention of announcing a preferred route for the section between junction 23 to 25 in the autumn.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Amber IPA DCA, the following primary project actions have impacted the original Q2 IPA DCA;

 - The project team announced the Preferred Route for Junctions 19-23  in October 2019. In the same month,  the project launched a non-statutory consultation on four route options between Junctions 23-25 of the A12 to accommodate the Garden Community. In November 2019, the project mobilised a programme of investigative surveys, which were designed to de-risk the preliminary design stage by providing geotechnical and condition data.
 - HE has now completed its internal procedures and the recommendation is going to IPDC on 15 June. Alongside this request, DfT and HMT will consider the use of Highways England Regional Delivery Partnerships as the project's procurement route and development phase funding, which will allow the project to proceed into the development phase of the scheme and prepare its' development consent order.

 - The planning inspector letter on the Local plan was expected by March 31st 2020, however was published on May 19th 2020. This meant there was greater uncertainty for the project for this period while scoping surveys and making preparations for the start of preliminary design.
 - In addition, Covid-19 has impacted on the project schedule. Traffic counts were cancelled in March 2020 due to the reduced traffic as a result of Covid-19 mitigations. The project has put in place revised traffic modelling strategies to minimise the impact of this.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) baseline project end date of 01/05/28, the following primary project actions have impacted the original Q2 baseline project end date;

 - The project has implemented mitigations to respond to the impact of Covid-19, such as revised traffic modelling and a complete review of method statements to ensure activities being undertaken to progress the project are safe.
 - To ensure the project could progress as quickly as possible, two route proposals for Junctions 23 to 25 were progressed through Highways England governance processes (Normally this would be one route). This allowed the project additional time to wait for the Planning Inspector's letter whilst minimising the impact on schedule.

There was concern that the removal of Private Finance as an option would increase costs to a point where the VfM would be too low to sustain the project. This issue has since been resolved with Treasury approval of the OBC in Oct 2019.
 - One of the key risks to the project was Highways England's confidence in successfully passing Development Consent Order (DCO) given the high profile challenges to the scheme from 3rd parties, such as heritage and environmental lobbying groups.

 - Due to falling ridership numbers as a consequence of Covid-19, Tfl revenues have dramatically decreased and conversations are currently ongoing regarding TfL's continued ability to fund the project. Talks are ongoing with TfL to mitigate substantial drops in revenues due to falling ridership numbers.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Red IPA DCA, the following primary project actions have impacted the original Q2 IPA DCA;

 - CRL's Delivery Control Schedule (DCS) began to be implemented, this showed early and consistent challenges to meeting milestones. Despite the challenges of delivering the DCS, CRL believe that the Stage 3 opening of the central section in Summer 2021 is still achievable - though acknowledge this would be tight and could have implications for delivery dates of full services. In an attempt to add greater focus on coordination and delivery of the project, CRL added an additional member to their executive team which means there is now a chief programme office and chief project officer in an attempt to increase productivity and delivery.
 - In November 2019, a revised AFCDC that was aligned to the DCS indicated that it would not be possible to deliver the project within the available funding and would require between Ł400 to Ł650m in additional funding. Based on analysis  DfT, HMT, TfL and GLA have agreed a funding shortfall target. Discussions are ongoing regarding a revised funding agreement between HMT, TfL and DfT and a further waiver has been agreed until 22 July to further funding negotiations.
 - An Arcadis review highlighted a Network Rail On Network Works (ONW) funding gap of Ł140.6m. The February 2020 Network Rail portfolio board have approved an increase of Ł140m for Crossrail On Network Works.

 - At the November 2019 CRL Board CRL announced a slippage to the revised 6-month opening window for the central section (Stage 3: Paddington to Abbey Wood  excluding Bond Street) stating that the range of opening dates were now between February 2021 - November 2021 with a mid-point of Summer 2021. The CRL Chairman told the TfL Board in June 2020 that he still expects the central section to open in Summer 2021. Stage 5 completion, with services running from Shenfield and Abbey Wood out to Reading and Heathrow, is expected to be 12 months later.

 - Pre Covid-19: CRL stated that they believe that the Stage 3 opening of the central section in Summer 2021 is still achievable  - though this is tight and could impact delivery dates of full services. CRL reported that their internal Trial Running target date 23 September 2020 is under pressure. In March 2020, CRL reported that the achievability of their Trial Running target date is at risk of slipping by between 1 to 3 months, Trial Running would, at the earliest, commence on 12 October 2020. Issues affecting the deadline include the quality, requirements and timeline of the assurance submissions.       

 - In an attempt to add greater focus on coordination and delivery of the project, CRL added an additional member to their executive team which means there is now a chief programme office and chief project officer in an attempt to increase productivity and delivery.

 - Significant Cost and schedule pressures emerged on Phase One in late 2018, as HS2 Ltd updated its baseline, with inclusion of actual market prices, in readiness for Notice-to-Proceed (the formal start of construction). 
 - Despite remedial activity to improve the cost (and schedule) position, it became clear that it would not be possible to deliver the existing Sponsors Requirements within the existing funding envelope and schedule targets. 
 - In August 2019, following a change in Prime Minister, Secretary of State, and in response to publication of the HS2 Chairmans Stocktake, the Government commissioned an independent review of the HS2 programme chaired by Doug Oakervee to consider whether, and how, to proceed with HS2.

Enabling Works and initial mobilising of the Main Works Civils are ongoing with sites generally open but there are likely to be some site or contractor-specific challenges to work through. 
 - There has been an increase in protestor action across the line of the route. This is a combination of long-standing action against the programme and a more recent uptick as a result of the emergence of environmental groups . This has created challenges to maintaining schedule.

 - Ł55.7bn (in 2015 prices) represented the then capital estimate for the HS2 project. Whereas ongoing pressures to the estimate and schedule were still being assessed by the Department at Q2 2019/20, there was further scrutiny placed on the project with the publication of the HS2 Chairmans Stocktake report in September. In addition, the independent Oakervee Review was commissioned at the time of producing the Q2 report. It was therefore considered inappropriate for the baseline capital estimate for the project to be amended at that time and the budget remained at Ł55.7bn.

There were also some further delays to the clearance of ancient woodlands, with some sites paused during the Oakervee Review. However, the project continues to pick up pace and drive forward with delivery. The ongoing COVID-19 situation has resulted in revised working methodologies for the project and HS2 Ltd has risen to these challenges. The rapid development and the uncertain outcome of the outbreak means it has not yet been possible to precisely determine its impact on the project. HS2 Ltd is currently working with its suppliers to assess the implications on schedule and cost. The current schedule and cost estimates contain contingency to address the issues which have arisen due to the pandemic.

Migration pace had increased considerably leading to the programme setting a stretch target of 50% completion by 31st December 2020, which demonstrated the increased level of confidence in programme team capability, leadership, and ability to work productively with suppliers.
 - Increased engagement with NHS England at regional level, and this has helped influence customer behaviours in order to increase pace of migrations

 - The degree of uncertainty and risk associated with in-service support has also been carefully managed; early decisions to retire risk have proven to be sound. 
","The baseline Whole Life Cost at Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) is Ł3,356.23 m, has decreased by Ł38.66 m since last year's Q2 1819 (Łm) baseline Whole Life Cost of Ł3,394.89 m, due primarily to the following factors;

 - The reduction in Whole Life Cost for the capability programme has been largely due to the slowdown driven by the period of poor availability.  Notable driving factors have also been: opportunities to change aircraft delivery schedules; and the retirement of risk.
 - The reduction in Whole Life Cost reflects a reduction in activity at the Front Line due to poor availability. E.g. the less the aircraft are flown the fewer spares they consume. Some efficiencies have been made during In Service Support contract negotiations.
 - There has been a small increase in Whole Life Cost for training provision largely due to revisions to the forecast software licensing costs.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Ł3,356.23 m baseline Whole Life Cost, the following non-project operating environment activities have impacted the original baseline Q2 Whole Life Cost;

 - Fluctuating foreign exchange rates continue to have an impact on the original forecast.
 - The ABC cost pressure within the MoD (particularly within the early years) is driving savings and deferments. This is not (in itself) significantly increasing risk against Programme delivery, as poor availability has introduced a degree of deferment realism.

 - Significant activity across all of the Defence Lines Of Development took place in order to rectify issues with weapons' clearances, infrastructure completion at RAF Marham and Sovereign Data Manager for Autonomic Logistics Information System integration on to UK networks. This all enabled the declaration of Capability Milestone 1, Initial Operational Capability from Land, on schedule in Dec 18 .
 - Post Initial Operational Capability declaration, in June 19, the Lightning Force undertook their first overseas deployment in order to test logistics and support at range. Due to early success the Lightning Force were able to conduct their first operational missions from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus in support of Operation SHADER.
 - Significant programme and pan-Defence Lines Of Development effort to effectively burn down provisos from Initial Operating Capability in order to deepen and sustain Initial Operational Capability also contributed to the improved picture maintaining significant momentum for this and future milestones.

","The IPA Delivery Confidence Assessment (DCA) rating at Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) was Amber, which has improved since last years Q2 1819 Amber/Red, due primarily to the following factors;

 - The Programme made significant progress to de-risk Initial Operating Capability position. Primarily, this was related to infrastructure and providing facilities for operating the aircraft in the first six months, both at Naval Air Station Jacksonville (Florida) and Kinloss Barracks, until RAF Lossiemouth infrastructure is ready (expected September 2020).
 - After three years of engineering and safety data gathering, analysis and assessment, the Programme achieved the required airworthiness certification which allowed the aircraft to receive its initial Release-to-Service and Military Type Certificate.
 - Work by the project achieved the necessary mission support facilities to enable initial Marine Patrol Aircraft training and operations, from both NAS Jacksonville and Kinloss. Early concerns around connectivity and ability to provide mission data had been successfully alleviated through forward-leaning intervention.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Amber IPA DCA, the following non-project operating environment activities have impacted the original Q2 IPA DCA;

 - The biggest long-term Programme risk remains the provision of personnel to enable the required growth path to Full Operating Capability. During this period, it became apparent that there were more concerns around the supporting elements necessary to meet workforce assumptions, particularly in engineering/maintenance.
 - Development of wider infrastructure at RAF Lossiemouth, including resurfacing of runways and other sustainment projects, has begun. Whilst outside the MPA Programme, this is a key dependency and good progress has been made which is reducing risk against remaining at Kinloss, the temporary operating base.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Amber IPA DCA, the following primary project actions have impacted the original Q2 IPA DCA;

 - The Programme has taken the decision to draw down supporting facilities and equipment at NAS Jacksonville earlier than planned to focus effort at the UK Main Operating Base at RAF Lossiemouth. This will improve spares and logistic provision and increase the Programme's resilience in the first year of operating.
 -  Further to the mission system preparatory work, the Programme allocated specific 'subject matter expert' personnel to help resolve some challenging integration issues. Although not entirely solved yet, good progress was made.

 - The improved confidence is attributable to the re-baseline of the Programme and approval of the Review Note with adjusted Control Total  by Investment Appraisal Committee Outletter on 8 April 19. This made the programme affordable and approved an adjusted timeline for Initial Operating Capability and Full Operational Capability and incorporated a 28 month slip. 
 - Confidence was also injected into the Programme g when the Direct Commercial Sales 2 Test & Evaluation Contract Milestone was achieved in Sep 19. Award of the infrastructure Phase 1 contract to Boeing UK as well as a number of successful smaller contracts and Critical Design Reviews have also boosted confidence. 
 - A steady increase in overall Reaper Force crew numbers has also improved confidence: this has been brought about by improved retention; Royal Australian Air Force exchange officers; and a pathway to using contractors to relieve Royal Air Force personnel at the deployed location. This gave more confidence that the 45 Reaper crews needed for Transition to Protector would be achieved by end 2020.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Amber IPA DCA, the following primary project actions have impacted the original Q2 IPA DCA;

 - DE&S will act as the Delivery Team for the Protector Infrastructure project at RAF Waddington. An exemption from using the Defence Infrastructure Organisation was granted in June 2019. The Protector facility project has been combined with that of E-7 Wedgetail,  this has allowed for efficiencies of design by creating shared spaces and use of a joint contracting strategy. 
 - The solution for the Synthetic Training System has been changed to ensure compliance and compatibility with Air's collective synthetic training programme. The impact to the programme cost and schedule are now understood and the amended solution will deliver an excellent capability. This item is still on the critical path but is now progressing. 
 - A contract for crews for the Reaper Launch and Recovery Element based at the deployed location (known as UK1) will take effect in June 2020. This will allow up to seven RAF crews (21 people) to be relieved from the forward deployed location and return to home units, boosting the numbers of crews available for mission control towards the 45 that will be needed for transition to Protector.

 - Technical issues were encountered with the new weapon design during the submarine launched trial resulting in the trial being abandoned. The data from this trial was urgently required to support the ongoing technical investigation into weapon reliability and performance of the upgraded fibre-optic guidewire dispensing system.
 - The Weapon Thread project will deliver the submarine combat system upgrades that are necessary to deploy the new weapon.  The schedule for delivery of these changes does not currently support a full transition to the upgraded weapon design before the old weapon design needs to be withdrawn from service.
 - Under the forecasted schedule for the Weapon Thread project the in-service conversion plan that will allow transition from the old weapon design to the new weapon design will place an extreme stress on the operational availability and reserve stockpile levels of the Spearfish Heavy Weight Torpedo.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Red IPA DCA, the following non-project operating environment activities have impacted the original Q2 IPA DCA;

 - At this point the trials programme for the new weapon was dependent on submarine and surface asset availability and, given the operational demand for these assets, it was increasingly difficulty to successfully co-ordinate trials with RN platform availability. Since September 2019 a trials strategy has been developed that mitigates this dependency.

 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Red IPA DCA, the following primary project actions have impacted the original Q2 IPA DCA;

 - Confidence in the weapon design, especially the fibre-optic dispensing system, has increased significantly following improvements in the manufacturing process, further shore-based testing and a successful repeat of Boat Trial 2. The weapon design has now been frozen and future trials are planned to improve the statistical confidence in weapon reliability.
 - An agreed safety case for the Weapon Thread Minimum Operating Capability design and completion of the Critical Design Review is required to progress through testing to manufacture. This has been the main effort of the Weapon thread team for several months and although not yet complete has progressed significantly.

 - Delivery of the upgraded weapon was subject to review due to the technical encountered during trials, however, it was still forecast to be significantly earlier than the date required to support operational use following platform conversion under Weapon Thread and therefore the overall forecast end date remained unchanged.
 - The Submarine Combat System upgrades are the key driver for the baseline end date. Delivery of these upgrades are expected to push the boundary of the existing MOD0 weapon life, which has become the de facto programme end date and this is relatively inflexible as it driven by weapon safety.

 - The in-year baseline costs for the Spearfish Programme included manufacturing and operational costs for the conduct of a number of in-water demonstration trials, including one very significant cost to conduct an overseas trial. Due to a combination of technical issues and RN Platform availability these trials were delayed.
 - During FY19/20 Navy Command requested DE&S to investigate potential savings measures to improve the Top Level Budget in-year Control Total position. The Spearfish Upgrade Project Team identified the costs allocated to the delayed in-water trials, offering to reprofile these costs into later years when these trials could be completed.

 - By Q2 1920 we had delivered most of what we had planned, but reform remains an extremely challenging and complex programme. It proved challenging to hire software developers for the Civil, Family and Tribunals programme which resulted in delay to the delivery of some services and associated benefits.
 -  Establishing a set of common capabilities that would support all the Civil, Family and Tribunal services proved challenging, and let to a change in strategy to ensure that we can use the common capabilities to run end to end services.
 - There were delays in the delivery of the common platform, which were caused by dependencies with other government agencies and challenges to the pace of software development. We have worked hard to implement a number of changes to pull back this delay.

 - Civil, Family and Tribunal programme continues to deliver products more slowly than expected. To address, CFT have agreed to a new approach, resequencing work to focus on completing both the Common Component and service elements of a single service (services already in delivery will continue as now).

 - Since the DCA Q2 1819 Amber/Red rating, considerable progress has been made to expand the team, including the appointment of external delivery partners, and improved governance. However, this programme has inherent risk. We are implementing a transition to a significantly different commercial model in the context of contracts that are operationally and commercially fragile. The timeline to achieve this transition has, on existing plans, negligible contingency. 
 - There are decisions around the Dynamic Framework, Accelerated Transition and potential contract extensions which mean the baseline will have to be reassessed and we cannot therefore be confident in moving the programme status to Amber at this stage.  Work is needed to: Complete discussions with CRCs on the potential early transition of case management in parts of England. Complete in-housing of offender management in Wales in December. Develop workforce strategy for probation, including the scope, policy direction and delivery plans for the Professional Recognition Programme.
 - The programme received an Amber/Red rating for its Programme Assurance Review which took place from 23- 27 Sept. The Review Team identified and praised the significant progress made since the last review but the Review Team concluded that the DCA should remain Amber / Red.  the Review sighted that risk assessed plans need  to be developed by workstream owners to give greater confidence in the delivery date and an opportunity to work up a more structured benefit delivery case, with some optionality on the balance of investment.


 Since the Q2 1920 (30th September 2019) Amber/Red IPA DCA, the following non-project operating environment activities have impacted the original Q2 IPA DCA;

 - The announcement of the General Election resulted in an impact assessment of the programme timeline. We  planned to publish the OJEU for the Probation Delivery Partner competition in early November 2019. Any event which leads to delays in obtaining approval to proceed and therefore delaying the publication of OJEU later than 16th December 2019 would have significant impact on the Programmes ability to deliver the transition to new providers by the due date.
 - Recruitment of  an additional 20,000 police officers  - the impacts and effects  flowing from this will affect the Programme Business Case and is therefore a factor that must be taken into account in assessing the overall DCA rating

ˇ       To create progression for apprentices - by creating high quality programmes that result in apprentices becoming fully competent with transferrable skills in an occupation that offers progression.
ˇ       To widen participation and social mobility in apprenticeships  to ensure that more people from a diverse range of backgrounds have access to the benefits of apprenticeships at all levels. 
ˇ       To create more quality apprenticeships - through our campaign work and by creating a sustainable funding system and a high quality apprenticeships offer.

We have successfully developed and implemented a new employer levy and funding system, designed and implemented a new digital online IT system which enables employers to manage their apprenticeship programmes and established a new Institute for Apprenticeships all of which completed in April 2017. We are supporting transition from apprenticeship frameworks to new employer designed standards, establishing ways to raise BAME participation rates by 20%, designing a policy to ensure inclusive apprenticeships to support social mobility and, with the support of the Institute, significantly uplifting the quality and quantity of apprenticeships. We will also implement a comprehensive strategy to support employers and providers to understand the changes to the apprenticeship system and ensure that the wider market is ready.","Apprenticeships will now phase the roll-out of the service to non-levy payers next year, rather than the big-bang approach originally planned.

This budget is very difficult to forecast as there is a lot of uncertainty around employer behaviour following the introduction of the new levy.  Starts delivered since introduction of the Levy in May continue to be very low and show a reduction of 61% compared to the same time last year. The new levy has transformed the way that Apprenticeships operate in addition to the transition from frameworks to standards. This is a lot of change for both employers and the market to get used to. Employer behaviour is hard to predict and it is very difficult to accurately forecast spend during a period of such uncertainty. Our updated forecast for 2017/18 reflects the reduction in the number of starts and also the slippage in our other spending plans as the need for enhancements to the Apprenticeships Funding Service are assessed. This has resulted in an expected underspend compared to baseline in 2017/18. 
As employers have 2 years to spend their levy funds It is likely that spending will increase in the next financial year resulting in higher than expected costs in 2019/20 and onwards. There is still a high level of uncertainty around these forecasts.
Enhancements and changes to the Apprenticeships Funding Service are still being planned and the split between investment in change and Recurring new costs reflects current known plans. This will be updated as further enhancements obtain ministerial approval.

The implementing Partner is experiencing delay in developing the tool required to complete the data migration between the existing system (PRISM) and the new system (Atlas). This delay impacts testing after the tool is available.  Consequently the Phase 1 Go live date has now slipped to April 2020 with the end of Phase 2 and overall Programme end date now forecast as August 2020.

The full year 2018-19 outturn for one-off Atlas implementation costs are currently estimated at Ł8.2m (prior to any end year adjustments) versus the Q2 Ł9.3m forecast (circa -12% variance). In part this variance has arisen due to greater knowledge now being known on the phasing of costs over the course of the Programme. Additionally following the appointment of the Programme implementing Partner (Accenture) in September 2018 spend has been lower than expected due to some delays in Accenture staff reaching the full profile of anticipated staff due to security clearance issues. The FCO has had similar delays hiring planned internal contractors with appropriate security clearances.

The high ends of the scheme and surface access cost ranges have been used. These costs will be revised as scheme planning progresses. HAL, for example, announced a potential reduction of up to Ł2.5bn in scheme costs in January 2018. Given scheme options are still being considered and will be subject to consultation, it is not currently possible to identify a firm scheme cost baseline.Government has made it clear that it expects the airport and industry to continue to work together towards the aim of delivering the ambition the Secretary of State set in 2016 for airport charges (the charge the airport charges airlines to use the airport) to remain close to current levels.The Government expects the scheme promoter to secure the upgrading or enhancing of road, rail or other transport networks or services which are physically needed to be completed to enable the Northwest Runway to operate. Where a surface transport scheme is not solely required to deliver airport capacity and has a wider range of beneficiaries, the Government, along with relevant stakeholders, will consider the need for a public funding contribution alongside an appropriate contribution from the airport on a case by case basis. The Government recognises that there may be some works which may not be required at the time the additional runway opens, but will be needed as the additional capacity becomes fully utilised. Heathrow Airport Ltds (HAL) operational costs are not included in the Whole Life Cost (WLC) here but are included in HALs plans which are under development.",2018,,,,

This will determine the requirement for construction versus refurbishment and this will determine whether the steel usage will be significant ","There is an approved risk management process that complies with Management of Risk by the Office of Government Commerce, part of the Best Management Practice series of guidance documents.    The risks around scope and cost pressures are still there but are gaining clarity and options for resolution with some key decisions already made with the DH. There is also escalating involvement of the business to resolve issues, including Value Management. There is a clear change management/request for change process that must be followed.   The formal stage 2 refresh review has continued.  Potential misalignment with requirements are being resolved and associated costs validated. The amount of potential change and VM exercises to manage costs is a significant challenge.  Key milestones achieved include production of a business change strategy, submission of outline planning permission and acquisition of the GSK Harlow site.  The programme is implementing plans to minimise the risk and impact of delay during the next phase.The programme has had an outline business case approved in December 2015 and the programme is developing a full business case for submission for approval to DH and HMT in 2019.

56,Automatic Enrolment Programme,DWP,Amber/Green,"The Automatic Enrolment Programme was established to implement the Governments workplace pension reforms. The overarching aim of the reforms is to get more people saving more for their retirement. The Programme went live in October 2012, delivering:   1) Automatic enrolment - a new duty on employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme; and to increase the incentive to remain saving in a pension scheme, there is a mandatory employer contribution.2) The National Employment Savings Trust  which has a public service obligation to accept any employer who wishes to use it to meet their employer duty. It provides a good quality pension to individuals on low to moderate earnings. 3) An employer compliance regime - run by the Pension Regulator to support these measures. The implementation approach is gradual, with employers being 'staged' by size, over the period October 2012 to February 2018, with original business case estimates forecasting an increase of savers between 6-9 million. Contributions to pension schemes are being gradually increased over time to provide a period of adjustment for employers and individuals, with full contributions being paid from April 2019. The original business case estimated that once contribution rates were fully phased in, pension savings as a result of AE would have increased by Ł8 billion per year.","Programme implementation has been, and continues to be, hugely successful so far with the original aim of 6-9 million employees automatically enrolled being achieved ahead of forecast. The Programme estimates in relation to the amount of increased savings have also increased significantly to Ł20 billion per year against an initial estimate of Ł8 billion per year.The Programme has in place a robust monitoring and evaluation strategy that draws information from all of the programme stakeholders and is reported routinely on a monthly basis. Our approach to monitoring is iterative and analytical colleagues continually look to enhance the options available. The outputs of this monitoring show that there continues to be high levels of compliance amongst the c.1million employers that have declared and opt-out rates amongst individuals remain consistently low at around 10%.The Programme is now focusing on supporting small and micro employers through the final months of roll-out, alongside preparing all employers, and their employees, for the forthcoming increases in pension contribution rates in April 2018 and April 2019. The Programme is also working to support employers that have been established since October 2017 and must automatically enrol new employees into a workplace pension from the outset. Whilst there remains a level of uncertainty around the ongoing behaviours of employers and employees, when balanced with the significant success of the Programme in achieving its objectives to date, the programme board rate the programme overall as Amber/Green.",01.05.07,30.11.19,"The Programme went live on time.

This will meet current and future business needs, refreshing and redesigning, where appropriate, office environments to support more flexible and new ways of working. It will do this whilst addressing underutilisation of around 30% of paid space that has built up throughout the PRIME contract.  Based on the current set of assumptions we are aiming to deliver a saving for the Department on estate running costs in excess of Ł100m per annum averaged over ten years, from April 2018. This will be achieved through a combination of paying for less space, cheaper rents and new facilities management arrangements; all in line with the Government future estates strategy. In addition, the Programme is an enabler of wider transformation of the Department, including Smart Working and modernising our estate.The Programme is complying with Section 1.06.1 of accompanying GMPP guidance regarding Ministerial request for confirmation of programmes with a steel component.","All but 2 x recommendations from the IPA Project Assessment Reviews (PARs) and Major Projects Review Group (MPRG) prior to June 2017 have been completed/actioned. Those carried forward were: The formal sign-off of lease agreements needs to be completed at the optimum time and recognising value for money objectives. The PLP needs to ensure that, using appropriate management information, explicit decisions are made on the basis of trade-offs between the time available and the achievement of value for money. PLP needs to de-risk the delivery of the procurement of the ETOM (Estates Target Operating Model). It should produce both a detailed procurement plan and TT (Telereal Trillium) exit strategy and develop a critical path. Working with partners, the PLP needs to identify and remove current significant barriers to progress by securing early additional resources and simplifying the procurement process. The PLP should ensure that appropriate contingencies are introduced and managed.The June 2017 IPA brought a further 8 x recommendations which are being actively managed, with action managers appointed for each one. All 8 remained outstanding as at 30 September 2017. The recommendations from the June IPA were: The Programme Team develops end to end plans for each individual site together with a robust integrated Programme plan including a Gantt chart with activities from other programmes where there are interdependencies. Business Continuity plans, primarily for the Capex impacted sites, should be refreshed and or created to ensure fitness for purpose for the short to medium term. The Programme Team to agree with internal and external approvals bodies the measures to streamline the approvals processes.  Review the Programme Board membership, presentation of Board papers including a dashboard and confirm/communicate the authority of the Programme Manager. The resourcing of the retained function needs to commence in parallel to the PLP implementation to ensure the right level and type of specialist skills are secured to ensure a seamless handover at the point when the TT contract expires to ensure effective management and maintenance of the VFM driven from the TT exit.  The FBC needs to be updated to reflect full TUPE, contingency, business continuity and Furniture, Fixture and Equipment (FFE) costs and associated risks must be managed. As roll out commences, monitor impact on staff and the business, particularly in the job centres/back of house to ensure lessons are learned and changes made for the ongoing roll out. This will include ensuring that people are given the right level/type of support to minimise the personal impact and consequent business disruption. PLP should prioritise core elements of work against non-essential activities, outlining how the deprioritised activities could be delivered post PLP implementation, including SMART working.There were a further 3 x recommendations from the 21 July MPRG, one of which was cleared by the end of June leaving the following outstanding as at 30 September: Programme to provide progress updates to MPRG in October on: The Programmes end-to-end plans for each individual site and how delivery is progressing against the integrated programme plan, including where there are interdependencies with other programmes (particularly Universal Credit).   A summary of the Programmes detailed contingency of continuity plans and the associated DEL costs, assuming that the Programme continues to provide details of site by site planning in the Programme Board papers (should be noted by the HMT any AME costs are incurred). The Departments plan for the estates and intelligent client function after March 2018, including the contractual relationships between that function, the integrator and the other pillars of the ETOM.

The current contract for these services is held by Vodafone and is due to expire for DFID and FCO in March 2018, and March 2019 for the British Council. Expiration of existing contracts for each partner organisation makes the procurements obligatory - retendering allows partners to harness new technology and thereby yield higher performance networks at lower costs The internal IT strategies of each partner organisation require more consistent and higher performing networks to enable transformation. There is also a cross-department 1HMG insistence to reduce operating costs, have better control, transparency, and assurance with regards to ongoing value for money. There is also a need for flexibility to change services in line with changing business practises, which the current contract does not permit. Key benefits include reducing ICT costs via a combined partner purchase power approach, providing Official commodity services and flexibility by disaggregation of service contracts, adopting new technologies and contributing significantly to the  One HMG overseas  initiative (involving progress towards Co-location, regionalisation, consolidation, collaboration and harmonisation) as well as partner sustainability targets.     ","The original OBC for the ECHO2 Programme was approved on 17th January 2017 by HM Treasury following earlier departmental approvals. Since the OBC was approved there have been a number of changes in approach. Whilst these are not substantive, the programme undertook an Accounting Officer to be satisfied that the Echo2 programme is within the approved OBC scope, and continuing to meet the four accounting officer standards of regularity, propriety, value for money and feasibility. The Accounting Officer Assessment was approved in November 2017. This is a complex multi-faceted governance arrangement due to the cross-government joint-partnership aspect of the programme. Governance structures were reviewed by the IPA in June 2017 and a revised structure was signed off by the Programme Board and Steering Group in July 2017. Due to the joint-partnership nature of this programme, the stakeholder community is also quite complex - however, the environment is stable in particular since the revised governance was agreed in July 2017. Stakeholder engagement is generally good with a number of stakeholder groups including engagement at a senior executive level via the Steering Group. Whilst Echo2 will operate in a complex international delivery environment, the programme will conduct proofs of concept and roll-out on an incremental basis. This project is to replace the underlying Voice and Video and Connectivity infrastructure for DfID, FCO and British Council. This will enable each partner to harness new and improved technologies, underpinning technical transformation strategies. This is not a departmental policy initiative for any of the key partners and therefore the risk of political impact is low. The programme anticipates, from market engagement exercise, that there will be reductions in like for like service costs. Such reductions are likely to be offset by greatly increasing bandwidth requirements over the lifetime of the new contract. As we progress, the relevant FBCs will require HMT approval to test the VFM criteria. A lack of permanent civil servant resources was particular concern raised by the IPA in July 2017. Since then a civil servant (currently MPLA) has filled the Programme Director position and more interim resources have been recruited to fill the resource gaps. The programme has defined each of the roles and regularly assesses the viability for in-sourcing dependant on the longevity of the role both to deliver the programme and also into specific BAU roles to ensure continuity. Programme timelines remain challenging; two of the partners will have commenced their contract exit period before the new procurements have completed; whilst there is a 2.5 year contract run off period, experience from across Government suggests that Exit/Transition very often takes longer than originally envisaged. ",01.09.15,31.03.20,"Following an IPA assessment, it was deemed prudent to re-evaluate the programme plan and procurement approach.

The emerging outcomes from the aforementioned work, including the ongoing development of the transition and exit roadmap for the ATLAS contract, have resulted in a delay to the procurements described in the IGBC with a consequential impact on MODNET EVOLVE sequencing and timeframes.

As there was a continuing need to manage ongoing SOP defects, a service management arrangement was formed involving eight key suppliers. There was also a move away from contractor-based support to managed service leading to resourcing and cost benefits. There continued a good collaboration with SSCL Business Partner & Delivery Teams (both within SSCL and the business) leading to stabilisation of service following SOP go live and improving KPI/SLA performance. There was strong leadership of the change from fixed to volumetric pricing for SSCL transactional services, driving significant cost savings for MoJ. SOP Optimisation: projects completed included DWP Go Live, Hyperion, Strategic Reachback, Skins Beta, Dom1 Windows 10/Office 365 compatibility, Apex Portal and Qlik proof of concept.",07.09.13,05.11.15,Programme is now closed.,43.86,46.03,398.07,Budget variance less than 5%,"The Whole Life Costs (WLC) represent the move to a fully outsourced service of the MoJs back office functions in line with the Government's Next Generation Shared Services Strategy. The current WLC includes Resource costs covering: programme team delivery, training, legal and development costs.

As noted in the final (Q4) GMPP return of 2016/17, any slippages have been absorbed into the overall programme costs so have resulted in a reduction in the overall anticipated cost across the life of the programme.In 2017/18, programme teams have continued to review the scope and delivery timelines of all current projects together with reviews of Capital / Resource as detailed costings become available.  At present, it is not anticipated that there will be any impact on whole life costs, however it is likely that there will be some changes within individual years spend. This is primarily due to additional scoping work to ascertain the detailed requirements for Case Management.
