       " 'The aim of the Liaison and Diversion programme is to improve health and criminal justice outcomes for offenders (or suspected offenders) with mental health, substance abuse, personality disorder, learning disabilities and other vulnerabilities.  This should be achieved by investing in services (Liaison and Diversion services) to screen, assess and refer offenders at the earliest possible point of the criminal justice system into relevant treatment and support, and that information from assessments is subsequently fed into the criminal justice process and can be used to inform decisions about justice outcomes, charging, prosecution and sentencing.  This fits with the strategic aims and objectives (offender rehabilitation to support reduced offending, and improved health and wellbeing outcomes) of each of the departments involved.  It is accepted by the Coalition Government that this direction of travel supports the business needs, as it was anticipated that early intervention and investment in health services for offenders across England will save money through reduced ongoing impacts on the criminal justice system.  Policy work is being taken forward by a cross government programme, funded through the SR settlement to DH and involving DH, Ministry of Justice and the Home Office, working with NHS England and Public Health England.  HMT has recently approved the Outline Business Case and trials of a standard service specification are due to commence in April 2014 (the programme is due to transfer to NHS England in March 2014).',\n",
       " 'Influenza is a viral infection of the respiratory system.  For some people, especially older people, young infants and people with underlying health conditions, it can cause serious even life-threatening complications and death. The impact of influenza on the population varies widely from year to year due to changes in the virus. However, one recent estimate considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisations (JCVI) suggest that each year, on average, approximately 0.75 million people may consult their GP, approximately 27, 000 people may be hospitalised and 4, 700 people may die in England because of influenza. Currently the programme provides influenza vaccination on the NHS for people aged 65 years and older and those aged under 65 with certain underlying health conditions (e.g. those with chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, pregnant women etc). \\n\\nJCVI has recommended that the current flu programme is extended to children aged 2 to less than 17 years. DH has a legal obligation, under the 2010 NHS Constitution , to offer new vaccines to the public that are recommended by JCVI and which are shown to be cost effective. The evidence reviewed by JCVI suggests that the extension to the current seasonal flu programme might result in around a 40% reduction in the death and hospitalisation figures shown above across the population, although there is large uncertainty either way in this estimate.  For this reason, JCVI recommends that the impact and cost effectiveness of the extended programme be reviewed within five years of the introduction to assess whether the expected benefits have been realised.\\n\\nWhen fully introduced this will be the largest immunisation programme offered in the UK, offering vaccine to more than 9 million children every autumn.  The programme is therefore being phased in to allow time to build up capacity and adopt learning from early pilots.\\n',\n",
