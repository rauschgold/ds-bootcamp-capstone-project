|3|colour_rating|- `Green` Successful delivery of the project on time, budget and quality appears highly likely and there are no major outstanding issues that at this stage appear to threaten delivery significantly. <br>- `Amber/green` Successful delivery appears probable; however, constant attention will be needed to ensure risks do not materialise into major issues threatening delivery.<br>- `Amber` Successful delivery appears feasible but significant issues already exist, require management attention. These appear resolvable at this stage and, if addressed promptly, should not present a cost/schedule overrun. <br>- `Amber/red` Successful delivery of the project is in doubt, with major risks or issues apparent in a number of key areas. Urgent action is needed to ensure these are addressed, and whether resolution is feasible. <br>- `Red` Successful delivery of the project appears to be unachievable. There are major issues with project definition, schedule, budget, quality and/or benefits delivery, which at this stage do not appear to be manageable or resolvable. The project may need re-scoping and/or its overall viability reassessed.|
