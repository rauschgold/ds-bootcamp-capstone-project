Features engineering:

- we can do hot encoding of **categories**: estimate the project amount based on categories 
 
- based on the **length of the project** we  can estimate the amount

-  In case there is money left and we want to invest  --> recommend project  based on the amount of money into "hopefully" a  project with monetized benefit. (to keep money flowing) 

the recommendation system could be based on the rating of the project 
 also hot encoding of the rating
